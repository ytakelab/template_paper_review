  abstract = {The discovery that ultrasound waves could be focused inside the skull and heated to high temperatures at a focal point goes back to 1944. However, because the skull causes the ultrasound waves to attenuate and scatter, it was believed that application of this technology would be difficult, and that it would be impossible to use this approach in the surgical treatment of intracranial diseases. Eventually, magnetic resonance image guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) surgery began being used to treat uterine fibroids, breast cancer and bone metastasis and locally confined prostate cancer. In the first ten years of the 21st century, new developments in this technology have been achieved, broadening the scope of practical application, and treatment is now being performed in various countries around the world. In 2011, third-generation transcranial focused ultrasound made it possible to use thermocoagulation and create intracranial lesions measuring 2 to 6 mm in diameter with a precision of around 1 mm. It was also possible to produce MR images which relay information of temperature changes in real time, enabling a shift from reversible test heating to irreversible therapeutic heating. This gave rise to the possibility of a minimally-invasive treatment with outcomes similar to those of conventional brain surgery. This method is paving the way to a new future not only in functional neurosurgery, but in cranial neurosurgery targeting conditions such as epilepsy and brain tumors, among others. In this paper, we describe the current state and future outlook of magnetic resonance image guided focused ultrasound, which uses computed tomography (CT) bone images in combination with MRI monitoring of brain temperature.},

To examine a possible causal contribution of gamma oscillations to cognitive function, recent studies have employed various types of brain stimulation to induce gamma oscillations. Techniques such as optogenetics or sensory stimulation appear to engage canonical neurocircuits that encompass excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, similarly to those driven by sensory experience, to induce gamma entrainment. Sensory evoked gamma entrainment improves cognitive function in mouse models. Oscillations have traditionally been studied at the neurophysiological level; however, sensory evoked gamma entrainment is able to induce gene expression changes in multiple cell types including neurons and microglia. Furthermore, evidence suggests that chronic gamma entrainment offers neuroprotective effects.},

  abstract = {The ventral hippocampus, unlike its dorsal counterpart, is required for anxiety-like behavior. The means by which it acts are unknown. We hypothesized that the hippocampus synchronizes with downstream targets that influence anxiety, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we recorded mPFC and hippocampal activity in mice exposed to two anxiogenic arenas. Theta-frequency activity in the mPFC and ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus was highly correlated at baseline, and this correlation increased in both anxiogenic environments. Increases in mPFC theta power predicted avoidance of the aversive compartments of each arena and were larger in serotonin 1A receptor knockout mice, a genetic model of increased anxiety-like behavior. These results suggest a role for theta-frequency synchronization between the ventral hippocampus and the mPFC in anxiety. They are consistent with the notion that such synchronization is a general mechanism by which the hippocampus communicates with downstream structures of behavioral relevance.},

Here, the early and late effects of tau pathology induction on functional network connectivity were investigated in P301L mice. Multichannel EEG oscillations were used to compute (1) coherent activity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) CA1-CA3 networks; (2) phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma~oscillations, which is instrumental in adequate cognitive functioning; (3) information processing as assessed by auditory evoked potentials and oscillations in the passive oddball mismatch negativity-like (MMN) paradigm. At the end, the density of tau aggregation and GABA parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Early weakening of EEG theta oscillations and coherent activity were revealed between the PFC and HPC CA1 and drastic impairments in theta\textendash gamma~oscillations PAC from week 2 onwards, while PV+ interneurons count was not altered. Moreover, the tau pathology disrupted the MMN complex amplitude and evoked gamma oscillations to standard and deviant stimuli suggesting altered memory formation and recall. The induction of intracellular tau aggregation by tau seed injection results in early altered connectivity and strong theta\textendash gamma oscillations uncoupling, which may be exploited as an early electrophysiological signature of dysfunctional neuronal networks.},

  abstract = {The medial septum (MS) complex modulates hippocampal function and related behaviours. Septohippocampal projections promote and control different forms of hippocampal synchronization. Specifically, GABAergic and cholinergic projections targeting the hippocampal formation from the MS provide bursting discharges to promote theta rhythm, or tonic activity to promote gamma oscillations. In turn, the MS is targeted by ascending projections from the hypothalamus and brainstem. One of these projections arises from the nucleus incertus in the pontine tegmentum, which contains GABA neurons that co-express the neuropeptide relaxin-3. Both stimulation of the nucleus incertus and septal infusion of relaxin-3 receptor agonist peptides promotes hippocampal theta rhythm. The Gi/o-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP3, is the cognate receptor for relaxin-3 and identification of the transmitter phenotype of neurons expressing RXFP3 in the septohippocampal system can provide further insights into the role of relaxin-3 transmission in the promotion of septohippocampal theta rhythm. Therefore, we used RNAscope multiplex in situ hybridization to characterize the septal neurons expressing Rxfp3 mRNA in the rat. Our results demonstrate that Rxfp3 mRNA is abundantly expressed in vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) mRNA- and parvalbumin (PV) mRNA-positive GABA neurons in MS, whereas ChAT mRNA-positive acetylcholine neurons lack Rxfp3 mRNA. Approximately 75\% of Rxfp3 mRNA-positive neurons expressed vGAT mRNA (and 22\% were PV mRNA-positive), while the remaining 25\% expressed Rxfp3 mRNA only, consistent with a potential glutamatergic phenotype. Similar proportions were observed in the posterior septum. The occurrence of RXFP3 in PV-positive GABAergic neurons gives support to a role of relaxin-3-RXFP3 system in septohippocampal theta rhythm.},

  abstract = {D-amphetamine maintenance therapy shows promise as a treatment for people with cocaine addiction. Preclinical studies using Long Access (LgA) cocaine self-administration procedures suggest D-amphetamine may act by preventing tolerance to cocaine's effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT). However, Intermittent Access (IntA) cocaine self-administration better reflects human patterns of use, is especially effective in promoting addiction-relevant behaviors, and instead of tolerance, produces psychomotor, incentive, and neural sensitization. We asked, therefore, how D-amphetamine maintenance during IntA influences cocaine use and cocaine's potency at the DAT. Male rats self-administered cocaine intermittently (5\,min ON, 25\,min OFF x10; 5-h/session) for 14 sessions, with or without concomitant D-amphetamine maintenance therapy during these 14 sessions (5\,mg/kg/day via s.c. osmotic minipump). We then assessed responding for cocaine under a progressive ratio schedule, responding under extinction and cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. We also assessed the ability of cocaine to inhibit dopamine uptake in the nucleus accumbens core using fast scan cyclic voltammetry ex vivo. IntA cocaine self-administration produced psychomotor (locomotor) sensitization, strong motivation to take and seek cocaine, and it increased cocaine's potency at the DAT. D-amphetamine co-administration suppressed the psychomotor sensitization produced by IntA cocaine experience. After cessation of D-amphetamine treatment, the motivation to take and seek cocaine was also reduced, and sensitization of cocaine's actions at the DAT was reversed. Thus, treatment with D-amphetamine might reduce cocaine use by preventing sensitization-related changes in cocaine potency at the DAT, consistent with an incentive-sensitization view of addiction.},

  abstract = {The reciprocal connections between the septum and the entorhinal area (EA) was studied in the rat brain using antero- and retrograde axonal transport methods. After injections of large volumes (2 \texttimes{} 100 nl) of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) into the medial septum (MS) and the diagonal band of Broca (dbB), anterogradely transported HRP-WGA was found primarily in layers II and IV of the medial and lateral EA. Injections of HRP-WGA (50\textendash 100 nl) or fluorescent dyes (50\textendash 100 nl) into different parts of the retrohippocampal region resulted in labeling, by retrograde axonal transport, of cells in the MS and dbB, both ipsi- and contralateral to the injected hemisphere. The labeled cells were either small (long axis of soma: 10\textendash 15 {$\mu$}m), round, and oval, or medium (15\textendash 25 {$\mu$}m) to large (25\textendash 35 {$\mu$}m) of fusiform or multipolar shape. By using the method of retrograde fluorescent double labeling, the septal afferents to the EA were found to give off collaterals to other parts of the hippocampal region. A much smaller number of septal cells appeared to send bilateral projections to the EA of both hemispheres. Studies employing retrograde transport of HRP in combination with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry on the same tissue section showed that, while a large number of cells projecting to the EA contain AChE, many projecting cells are devoid of AChE reaction products. These findings suggest that the septo-entorhinal projection consists of a cholinergic as well as a noncholinergic component. The entorhinal efferents to the septum were studied after injections of HRP-WGA into different parts of the retrohippocampal region. Labeled fibers could be traced through the fimbria to their terminal fields in the intermediate parts of the lateral septal nucleus and to the most lateral aspect of the vertical limb of the dbB. The cells giving rise to this projection were situated in layer IV of the medial and layers II through V of the lateral EA. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate a close anatomical relationship between the septum and the entorhinal area, in addition to the better known connections between the septum and the Ammon's horn.},

  abstract = {Decisiveness is the ability to commit to a decision quickly and efficiently; in contrast, indecision entails the repeated consideration of multiple alternative possibilities. In humans, the {$\alpha$}2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine increases decisiveness in tasks that require planning through unknown neural mechanisms. In rats, indecision is manifested as reorienting behaviors at choice points (vicarious trial and error [VTE]), during which hippocampal representations alternate between prospective options. To determine whether the increase in decisiveness driven by clonidine also entails changes in hippocampal search processes, we compared the effect of clonidine on spatial representations in hippocampal neural ensembles as rats passed through a T-shaped decision point. Consistent with previous experiments, hippocampal representations reflected both chosen and unchosen paths during VTE events under saline control conditions. Also, consistent with previous experiments, hippocampal representations reflected the chosen path more than the unchosen path when the animal did not show VTE at the choice point. Injection of clonidine suppressed the spatial representation of the unchosen path at the choice point on VTE laps and hastened the differentiation of spatial representations of the chosen path from the unchosen path on non-VTE laps to appear before reaching the choice point. These results suggest that the decisiveness seen under clonidine is due to limited exploration of potential options in hippocampus, and suggest novel roles for noradrenaline as a modulator of the hippocampal search processes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Clonidine, an {$\alpha$}2-adrenergic receptor agonist, which decreases the level of noradrenaline in vivo, has an interesting effect in humans and other animals: it makes them more decisive. However, the mechanisms by which clonidine makes them more decisive remain unknown. Researchers have speculated that clonidine limits the amount of mental search that subjects do when planning options. We test this hypothesis by measuring the mental search strategy in rats through hippocampal recordings. We find that clonidine limits the options searched by rats, suggesting that noradrenaline also plays a role in balancing exploration and exploitation in internally simulated behaviors, similar to its role in balancing exploration and exploitation in external behaviors.},

A body of evidence also suggests that the septal region affects experimental pain. Indeed, some explorations in humans have raised the possibility that the region may modulate clinical pain as well. This review explores the evidence that implicates the medial septum in nociception and suggests that non-overlapping circuits in the region facilitate acute nociceptive behaviors and defensive behaviors that reflect affect and cognitive appraisal, especially in relation to persistent nociception. In line with a role in nociception, the region modulates nociceptive responses in the neuraxis, including the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex. The aforementioned forebrain regions have also been implicated in persistent/long-lasting nociception. The review also weighs the effects of the medial septum on nociception vis-\`a-vis the known roles of the region and emphasizes the fact that the region is a part of network of forebrain structures which have been long associated with reward, cognition and affect-motivation and are now implicated in persistent/long-lasting nociception.},

Results showed that formalin-induced acute nociception was not affected by intraseptal microinjection of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist, or on selective lesion of septal GABAergic neurons. Indeed, the acute nociceptive responses were dissociated from the regulation of sensorimotor behaviour and generation of theta-rhythm by the GABAergic mechanisms in MSDB. The GABAergic lesion attenuated formalin-induced unconditioned cellular response in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and blocked formalin-induced conditioned place avoidance (F-CPA) and as well as the contextual fear induced on conditioning with brief footshock. The effects of lesion on nociceptive-conditioned cellular responses were, however, variable. Interestingly, the lesion attenuated the conditioned representation of experimental context in dorsal hippocampus field CA1 in the F-CPA task. Collectively, the preceding suggests that the MSDB is a nodal centre wherein the GABAergic neurons mediate nociceptive affect-motivation by regulating cellular mechanisms in ACC that confer an aversive value to the noxious stimulus. Further, in conjunction with a modulatory influence on hippocampal contextual processing, MSDB may integrate affect with context as part of associative learning in the F-CPA task.},

The effect of intraseptal muscimol on PH was comparable to that seen with microinjection of the local anesthetic, lidocaine, into rostral ventromedial medulla which is implicated in facilitating experimental chronic nociception. Cellular analysis in the CCI model showed that the MS region sustains nociceptive gain with CCI by facilitating basal nociceptive processing and the amplification of stimulus-evoked neural processing. Indeed, consistent with the idea that excitatory transmission through MS facilitates chronic experimental pain, intraseptal microinjection of antagonists acting at AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors attenuated CCI-induced PH. We propose that the MS is a central monitor of bodily nociception which sustains molecular plasticity triggered by persistent noxious insult.},

In this study, we investigated the properties of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in medial septal neurons of the rat in an in vitro slice preparation. Immunocytochemistry with a selective antibody to the GluR2 subunit revealed that both choline acetyltransferase-containing and parvalbumin-containing neurons of the medial septum express no detectable GluR2 subunit immunoreactivity. We used whole cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure synaptically evoked AMPA receptor-mediated currents from medial septal neurons following stimulation of midline afferents. The GYKI 52466 (50 {$\mu$}M)- and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) (20 {$\mu$}M)-sensitive AMPA receptor-mediated component of the synaptic response was isolated by blocking GABAA- andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents with 30 {$\mu$}M bicuculline and 100 {$\mu$}M 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, respectively. In some cases, patched cells were filled with Lucifer yellow (0.1\%) and imaged using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. AMPA receptor-mediated currents that were observed in large medial septal neurons (20\textendash 30 {$\mu$}m) displayed rectification. These currents were sensitive to external application of philanthotoxin-343 (PhTx-343, 50 {$\mu$}M), a potent, high-affinity antagonist of Ca2+-permeable, GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors. Rectifying AMPA receptor-mediated currents also displayed a rapid increase in amplitude when evoked five times at low frequency such as 6 Hz. In contrast to currents observed in large medial septal neurons, AMPA-receptor mediated currents evoked in the remaining small (8\textendash 11 {$\mu$}m) neurons were nonrectifying and displayed rapid synaptic depression when stimulated five times at 6 Hz. The currents evoked in these cells were unaffected by external application of PhTx-343 and were therefore GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. The results of the present study demonstrate that the principal projection neurons of the medial septum contain PhTx-343-sensitive, GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors that display rapid current facilitation when stimulated at low frequencies.},

In the present study, the effects of the interactions between the opioidergic system in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) and the GABAergic system in the medial septum on anxiety in male Wistar rats were investigated. Main methods An elevated plus maze was used to study the effects of anxiogenic and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. Male Wistar rats were used for this test. We injected morphine (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5{$\mu$}g/rat) into the CA1 and GABAA agonist muscimol (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0ng/rat) into the intra-medial septum (MS). Conversely, we detected the microinjection of bicuculline, a GABAA antagonist (10, 20, and 30ng/rat), into the MS. OAT\%, OAE\% and locomotor activity were determined by this behavioral test. Key findings We found that the simultaneous administration of intra-CA1 morphine (2.5{$\mu$}g/rat) and intra-MS muscimol (2.5ng/rat) increased the magnitude of anxiolysis. On the other hand, simultaneous administration of intra-CA1 morphine (7.5{$\mu$}g/rat) and intra-MS bicuculline decreased the anxiolytic effect. Significance In conclusion, our data suggest that the opioidergic system in the CA1 is involved in anxiety-related behavior and influences the GABAergic system within the MS. In addition, we observed that the interactions between the opioidergic and GABAergic systems within the septohippocampus increased anxiety-related behavior compared to stimulation of these receptor systems independently.},

Two cell populations in the medial septal area were differentiated on the basis of their spontaneous discharge pattern, response to median raphe nucleus stimulation and whether or not they were antidromically activated following hippocampal stimulation. Medial septal area cells classified as I-neurones discharge in an irregular pattern which was unrelated to hippocampal activity. In contrast, B-neurones discharge in either rhythmic bursts or in an irregular manner which were related to hippocampal `theta' or `desynchronization', respectively. Single pulse stimulation of the median raphe nucleus inhibited the spontaneous discharge of I-neurones but did not influence the firing of B-neurones or hippocampal activity. Repetitive stimulation of the median raphe nucleus resulted in a prolonged inhibition of I-neurones, a disruption of the bursting discharge of B-neurones, and desynchronization of the hippocampal `theta'. The effects of median raphe nucleus stimulation were blocked by pretreatment with parachlorophenylalanine suggesting that a serotonin-containing system originating in the median raphe nucleus may be involved in mediating these responses.},

  abstract = {Although the presence and importance of oscillations in cortical structures is well-documented, little is known about this rhythmic activity in subcortical areas. In waking guinea pigs, during their inattentive rest, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously in eight brain structures. In the cortical areas (prefrontal and entorhinal fields, hippocampus, dentate gyrus) and subcortical ones (medial and lateral septal nuclei, central nucleus of amygdala, and supramammillary nucleus), different types of oscillations were observed: delta (0.5\textendash 4Hz), theta (4\textendash 8), alpha (10\textendash 12), gamma (40\textendash 80), and high-frequency, presumable ripples (100\textendash 200Hz). In all structures, low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta) were more powerful than high-frequency ones. Structural communications in different bands of rhythmic activity were expressed differently. On the whole they were the more intensive, the stronger were the oscillations, however, this was not the absolute rule. A long-term (about a month) daily injection of l-glutamate into the medial septal region induced significant changes in theta, gamma, and high-frequency oscillations in most regions examined. The correlations of some structures also changed; they significantly decreased between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in the theta band and between the medial septum and central amygdala in the gamma band. During permanent septal glutamate infusion, distinct signs of epileptogenesis were revealed (epileptiform activity, seizure behavior of animals, and formation of aberrant fibers in the hippocampus). Thus, we believe that the glutamatergic system of medial septum can participate in the development of epilepsy. The earliest sign of pathology in electrical activity was alterations in high-frequency oscillations in the dentate gyrus and medial septum, but the strongest changes were in theta and especially gamma rhythms in many structures. The data obtained help to advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of brain functioning and its disturbances in seizure pathology.},

These two issues \textemdash{} encoding and decoding \textemdash{} lead to complementary perspectives about the role of correlations.In the encoding perspective, the information encoded in a population of correlated neurons is compared with the information that would be encoded if the population were uncorrelated.In the decoding perspective, the amount of information lost if correlations are ignored when decoding is measured. Note that the decoding perspective is much more subtle than the encoding perspective \textemdash{} it asks whether a potentially suboptimal strategy, ignoring correlations, really is suboptimal, and, if so, just how bad it is.If we knew only that neural responses were correlated, we would not know whether or not those correlations affected information encoding, nor would we know whether or not they affected decoding strategies. Furthermore, correlations can increase, decrease or not affect the amount of information encoded, just as they can affect or not affect the amount of information extracted using a decoder that ignores correlations.As a corollary to the previous point, the information present in neural responses, as well as the change in information due to attentional or learning-related factors, cannot be estimated by single neuron recordings.At the level of pairs of neurons, the measured effects of correlations on encoding and decoding have been small (in all but one study less than {$\sim$}10\%) across many brain areas and species.Correlations can have a large effect at the population level even when they have a small effect at the level of pairs. Consequently, results obtained for pairs of neurons cannot be directly extrapolated to populations, a fact that is true for both encoding and decoding.},

This hypothesis continues to inform modern economic theory2 and research in behavioural economics3, but behavioural measures are ultimately not sufficient to verify the proposal4. Consistent with the hypothesis, when agents make choices, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods5. Value-encoding cells integrate multiple dimensions6\textendash 9, variability in the activity of each cell group correlates with variability in choices10,11 and the population dynamics suggests the formation of a decision12. However, it is unclear whether these neural processes are causally related to choices. More generally, the evidence linking economic choices to value signals in the brain13\textendash 15 remains correlational16. Here we show that neuronal activity in the OFC is causal to economic choices. We conducted two experiments using electrical stimulation in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Low-current stimulation increased the subjective value of individual offers and thus predictably biased choices. Conversely, high-current stimulation disrupted both the computation and the comparison of subjective values, and thus increased choice variability. These results demonstrate a causal chain linking subjective values encoded in OFC to valuation and choice.},

MS lesions impaired spatial working memory on the T maze, thus resembling the effects of dorsal hippocampal lesions. In addition, MS lesions reduced anxiety during successive alleys (a modified form of the elevated plus-maze), social interaction, and hyponeophagia tests. MS lesions also reduced postshock freezing. These effects more closely resemble those of ventral hippocampal lesions. Therefore, the effects of electrolytic MS lesions derive from the resulting combined deafferentation of dorsal and ventral hippocampal regions, suggesting that previously reported effects of cytotoxic dorsal hippocampal lesions are unlikely to be due to a demyelination of fibers of passage coursing through the septal pole.

This was more plausibly a result of reduced susceptibility to fear than a result of a lesion-induced increase in general motor activity. There was no consistent difference between sham and lesioned animals in spontaneous locomotor activity, or locomotion following acute or chronic treatment with amphetamine. In contrast, ventral hippocampal lesioned animals were quicker to pass from the black to the white box during a modified version of the light/dark exploration test, and were quicker to begin eating during tests of hyponeophagia. Furthermore, rats with ventral hippocampal lesions defecated less than their sham counterparts both during open field testing and in extinction sessions following contextual conditioning. In contrast to these clear lesion effects, there were no signs of any spatial learning impairment either in the watermaze or on the elevated T-maze. Taken together these results suggest that the ventral hippocampus may play a role in a brain system (or systems) associated with fear and/or anxiety, and provide further evidence for a distinct specialisation of function along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus.},

Methods This is a retrospective multicenter study. We performed a descriptive analysis and subsequently carried out multivariable mixed-effect models corrected for multiple comparisons. Results We analyzed data from 511 patients (114 children) and observed significant differences in several clinical features between adults and children. The possibility of achieving Engel class IA outcome and discontinuing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at last follow-up (FU) was significantly higher in children (P = .006 and {$<$} .0001). However, percentages of children and adults in Engel class I at last FU (mean {$\pm$} SD, 45.9 {$\pm$} 17 months in children; 45.9 {$\pm$} 20.6 months in adults) did not differ significantly. We identified different predictors of seizure outcome in children vs adults and at short- vs long-term FU. The only variables consistently associated with class I outcome over time were postoperative electroencephalography (EEG) in adults (abnormal, improved,odds ratio [OR] = 0.414, P = .023, Q = 0.046 vs normal, at 2-year FU and abnormal, improved, OR = 0.301, P = .001, Q = 0.002 vs normal, at last FU) and the completeness of resection of temporal magnetic resonance (MR) abnormalities other than hippocampal sclerosis in children (OR = 7.93, P = .001, Q = 0.003, at 2-year FU and OR = 45.03, P {$<$} .0001, Q {$<$} 0.0001, at last FU). Cognitive outcome was best predicted by preoperative performances in either age group. Significance Clinical differences between adult and pediatric patients undergoing TLE surgery are reflected in differences in long-term outcomes and predictors of failures. Children are more likely to achieve sustained seizure freedom and withdraw AEDs after TLE surgery. Earlier referral should be encouraged as it can improve surgical outcome.},

The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of norepinephrine in the brain, is considered to be involved in attentional control by modulating the neuronal activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, evidence for the causal role of LC activity in attentional control remains elusive. Here, by using behavioral and optogenetic techniques, we investigate the effect of LC neuron activation or inhibition in operant tests measuring attention and response inhibition (i.e., a measure of impulsive behavior). We show that LC neuron stimulation increases goal-directed attention and decreases impulsivity, while its suppression exacerbates distractibility and increases impulsive responding. Remarkably, we found that attention and response inhibition are under the control of two divergent projections emanating from the LC: one to the dorso-medial PFC and the other to the ventro-lateral orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. These findings are especially relevant for those pathological conditions characterized by attention deficits and elevated impulsivity.},

  abstract = {The management of depression remains a constant challenge in clinical practice. This is largely due to the fact that initial treatments frequently do not lead to remission and recovery. The current treatment approach involves lengthy trial-and-error periods. It would be beneficial to have early reliable predictors to determine whether patients will respond to treatment or not. Electroencephalography (EEG) derived biomarkers namely change in the activity of EEG frequency bands, hemispheric alpha asymmetry, theta cordance, the antidepressant treatment response index (ATR) and evoked potentials have all been shown to predict response to a variety of antidepressant medications. However, the neurobiology in support of this association has been largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss biological mechanisms for each EEG derived biomarker predictive of treatment response. Validating such biomarkers will not only greatly aid clinicians in selecting antidepressant treatment for individual patients but will also provide a critical step in drug discovery.},

  abstract = {The habenula (Hb) is an evolutionary well-conserved structure located in the epithalamus. The Hb receives inputs from the septum, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, and projects to several midbrain centers, most importantly the inhibitory rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and the excitatory interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which regulate the activity of midbrain monoaminergic nuclei. The Hb is postulated to play a key role in reward and aversion processing across species, including humans, and to be implicated in the different stages of transition from recreational drug intake to addiction and co-morbid mood disorders. The Hb is divided into two anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei, the lateral (LHb) and the medial (MHb), which are primarily involved in reward-seeking (LHb) and misery-fleeing (MHb) behavior by controlling the RMTg and IPN, respectively. This review provides a neuroanatomical description of the Hb, discusses preclinical and human findings regarding its role in the development of addiction and co-morbid mood disorders, and addresses future directions in this area.},

Throughout its history the Tulane research was well publicized in both the professional and lay literature, and for almost twenty years, with rare exception, these accounts were laudatory. However, in the early 1970s this work began to draw sharp public criticism. Despite its public and controversial nature, the Tulane electrical brain stimulation program has received relatively little attention from historians.

Preclinical studies on neuronal impairments associated with progressive amyloidosis have demonstrated some A{$\beta$}-dependent neuronal dysfunction including modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic signaling. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broad repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the neuronal network functioning using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the hippocampus (HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), followed by pathological analyses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor subunits {$\alpha$}1, {$\alpha$}5, and {$\delta$}, and glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67). Concomitant to amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, low-gamma band power was strongly attenuated in the HPC and mPFC of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the phase-amplitude coupling of the neuronal networks in both areas was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude in TgF344-AD animals. Finally, the gamma coherence between HPC and mPFC was attenuated as well. These results demonstrate significant neuronal network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology. This network dysfunction precedes the onset of cognitive deficits and is likely driven by A{$\beta$} and tau pathologies. This article is part of the Special Issue ``Vascular Dementia''.},

I suggest that addiction is the product of an imbalance between two separate, but interacting, neural systems that control decision making: an impulsive, amygdala system for signaling pain or pleasure of immediate prospects, and a reflective, prefrontal cortex system for signaling pain or pleasure of future prospects. After an individual learns social rules, the reflective system controls the impulsive system via several mechanisms. However, this control is not absolute; hyperactivity within the impulsive system can override the reflective system. I propose that drugs can trigger bottom-up, involuntary signals originating from the amygdala that modulate, bias or even hijack the goal-driven cognitive resources that are needed for the normal operation of the reflective system and for exercising the willpower to resist drugs.},

We introduce a new ultrasound stimulation technique, based on single ultrashort ultrasound pulses (transcranial pulse stimulation, TPS) and describe a first navigable clinical TPS system. Feasibility, safety and preliminary (uncontrolled) efficacy data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are provided. Simulation data, \emph{in vitro} measurements with rat and human skulls/brains and clinical data in 35 AD patients were acquired in a multicentric setting (including CERAD scores and functional MRI). Preclinical results show large safety margins and patient results show high treatment tolerability. Neuropsychological scores improved significantly when tested immediately as well as 1 and 3 months after stimulation and fMRI data displayed significant connectivity increases within the memory network. The results encourage broad neuroscientific application and translation of the new method to clinical therapy and randomized sham-controlled studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using the waveform-based theta phase, three distinct gamma bands were identified: slow gammaS (gammaS; 30\textendash 50 Hz), midfrequency gammaM (gammaM; 50\textendash 90 Hz), and fast gammaF (gammaF; 90\textendash 150 Hz or epsilon band).

  abstract = {In the present study, we have investigated the developmental expression of the transmitter-synthesizing enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in rat medial septal neurons by using in situ hybridization histochemistry. In addition, we have employed immunostaining for ChAT and the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, known to be contained in septohippocampal GABAergic neurons. A large number of GAD67 mRNA-expressing neurons were already observed in the septal complex on embryonic day (E) 17, the earliest time point studied. During later developmental stages, there was mainly an increase in the intensity of labeling. Neurons expressing ChAT mRNA were first recognized at E 20, and their number slowly increased during postnatal development of the septal region. The adult pattern of ChAT mRNA-expressing neurons was observed around postnatal day (P) 16. By using a monoclonal ChAT antibody, the first immunoreactive cells were not seen before P 8. Similarly, the first weakly parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were seen in the septal complex by the end of the 1st postnatal week. These results indicate that in situ hybridization histochemistry may be an adequate method to monitor the different development of transmitter biosynthesis in cholinergic and GABAergic septal neurons. Moreover, the late onset of ChAT mRNA expression would be compatible with a role of target-derived factors for the differentiation of the cholinergic phenotype. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Combining optogenetic control of hippocampal theta oscillations with electrophysiological recordings in mice, we show that hippocampal theta oscillations regulate locomotion. In particular, we demonstrate that their regularity underlies more stable and slower running speeds during exploration. More regular theta oscillations are accompanied by more regular theta-rhythmic spiking output of pyramidal cells. Theta oscillations are coordinated between the hippocampus and its main subcortical output, the lateral septum (LS). Chemo- or optogenetic inhibition of this pathway reveals its necessity for the hippocampal regulation of running speed. Moreover, theta-rhythmic stimulation of LS projections to the lateral hypothalamus replicates the reduction of running speed induced by more regular hippocampal theta oscillations. These results suggest that changes in hippocampal theta synchronization are translated into rapid adjustment of running speed via the LS.},

  abstract = {Current on Demand Deep brain electrical stimulation can be a successful therapy in Parkinson's disease, in depression, and in several other psychiatric diseases, especially in drug-resistant cases. Unfortunately, chronic, continuous stimulation is associated with multiple side effects. This could be alleviated by delivering the electrical perturbation only when it is necessary, using closed-loop stimulation. Such an approach is essential for epilepsy, where seizures occur very rarely but with serious consequences. In a rat model for epilepsy, Ber\'enyi et al. (p. 735) prevented seizures by transcranial electrical stimulation using a closed-loop system. Transcranial electrical stimulation was highly effective and reduced seizure duration, on average, by 60 \%. Many neurological and psychiatric diseases are associated with clinically detectable, altered brain dynamics. The aberrant brain activity, in principle, can be restored through electrical stimulation. In epilepsies, abnormal patterns emerge intermittently, and therefore, a closed-loop feedback brain control that leaves other aspects of brain functions unaffected is desirable. Here, we demonstrate that seizure-triggered, feedback transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can dramatically reduce spike-and-wave episodes in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. Closed-loop TES can be an effective clinical tool to reduce pathological brain patterns in drug-resistant patients. In a rodent model of petit mal epilepsy, the onset of a seizure triggers an electrical pulse that cuts short the seizure.

Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for neural representation of pleasure in the brain (gained largely from neuroimaging studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (gained largely from brain manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core pleasure or `liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes surprisingly localized. Pleasure `liking' is especially generated by restricted hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread.},

Results revealed that change in discounting was inversely related to baseline rates of discounting, such that participants with low discount rates showed little change in discounting with treatment, whereas participants with high discount rates showed large reductions in discounting. As importantly, those treatments that produced the largest gains in drug abstinence had the largest effects on discount rates.

  abstract = {Damage to the hippocampus in humans can cause profound impairments in long-term episodic memory, but the precise functional contribution of the hippocampus remains the subject of several competing theories.Electrophysiological studies in rodents have characterized the firing properties of 'place cells' in the hippocampus in great detail. Place cells appear to represent where an animal 'thinks' it is located in an environment, relative to environmental boundaries. Acting cooperatively, place cells encode specific environments, performing both pattern completion and pattern separation.A new model of hippocampal processing that is driven by the properties of place cells (the BBB model) provides an alternative to existing psychological theories, at least in the spatial domain. The BBB model proposes that the hippocampus is needed to impose a location from which to retrieve and construct a coherent mental image of an environment. This mental image supports the online maintenance and manipulation of representations of the locations of objects and features in an environment.The model suggests that episodic memory will always be hippocampus-dependent if it is associated with rich mental imagery of an environment. Other sophisticated long-term spatial (and non-spatial) representations can be acquired, stored and retrieved independent of the hippocampus. However, the hippocampus is often needed to mediate behaviours that allow such learning to take place (such as when learning a new route).The BBB model further suggests that the hippocampus is required for both short-term and long-term memory for some types of information, for imagining complex visual scenes (be they real or fictitious), and more for the recognition of scenes than faces. Recent experimental evidence from studies of the effects of damage to the hippocampus in humans supports all three of these proposals.Hippocampal processing beyond the spatial domain cannot be explained by the BBB model, but several theoretical positions have been advanced to address the broader role of the hippocampus in mnemonic processing.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat intractable pain for over 50 years. Variations in targets and surgical technique complicate the interpretation of many studies. To better understand its efficacy, we performed a meta-analysis of DBS for pain relief. MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) databases were searched using key words deep brain stimulation, sensory thalamus, periventricular gray and pain. Inclusion criteria were based on patient characteristics and protocol clarity. Six studies (between 1977\textendash 1997) fitting the criteria were identified. Stimulation sites included the periventricular/periaqueductal grey matter (PVG/PAG), internal capsule (IC), and sensory thalamus (ST). The long-term pain alleviation rate was highest with DBS of the PVG/PAG (79\%), or the PVG/PAG plus sensory thalamus/internal capsule (87\%). Stimulation of the sensory thalamus alone was less effective (58\% long-term success) (p{$<$}0.05). DBS was more effective for nociceptive than deafferentation pain (63\% vs 47\% long-term success; p{$<$}0.01). Long-term success was attained in over 80\% of patients with intractable low back pain (failed back surgery) following successful trial stimulation. Trial stimulation was successful in approximately 50\% of those with post-stroke pain, and 58\% of patients permanently implanted achieved ongoing pain relief. Higher rates of success were seen with phantom limb pain and neuropathies. We conclude that DBS is frequently effective when used in well-selected patients. Neuroimaging and neuromodulation technology advances complicate the application of these results to modern practice. Ongoing investigations should shed further light on this complex clinical conundrum.},

This review summarizes the findings in the central and peripheral nervous systems from mechanistic studies in cell culture to cognitive behavioral studies in humans.

An in-depth safety assessment of current studies shows that parameters for the human studies fall within the safety envelope for US imaging. Challenges associated with accurately targeting US and monitoring the response are described. In conclusion, the literature supports the use of US as a safe, non-invasive brain stimulation modality with improved spatial localization and depth targeting compared with alternative methods. US neurostimulation has the potential to be used both as a scientific instrument to investigate brain function and as a therapeutic modality to modulate brain activity.},

  abstract = {Single cells or simultaneously recorded cell pairs in the medial septum (MS) vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (vDBB) in the urethane-anesthetized rat were initially classified as either theta-on or non-related according to the system of Colom and Bland (1987, Brain Res 422:277-286). Subgroups of these cells were then studied under various test conditions that included electrical stimulation of the nucleus pontis oralis (PO) or posterior hypothalamus (PH), microinfusion of carbachol into the PO or PH, and the microinfusion of atropine sulfate or procaine hydrochloride into the PH. Electrical stimulation of either the PO or PH induced theta (theta) activity in the hippocampal formation (HPC), and electrical stimulation of the PO resulted in a simultaneous increase in the discharge rate of all MS/vDBB theta-on cells tested, compared to the rates recorded during HPC large-amplitude irregular activity (LIA). Five of the MS/vDBB theta-on cells were tested consecutively with electrical stimulation of the PO and PH, and were shown to be activated in a similar manner in either condition. Microinfusion of carbachol into either the PO or PH resulted in the induction of HPC theta field activity and the simultaneous intense activation of all MS/vDBB theta-on cells tested. Following the microinfusion of either atropine sulfate or procaine into the PH, electrical stimulation of the PO failed to induce HPC theta field activity or the concomitant rhythmic discharges of all MS/vDBB phasic theta-on cells tested. Microinfusing procaine into the PH also abolished the coupling between all MS/vDBB cell pairs during HPC theta field activity including that between two cell pairs that were coupled during HPC LIA. The data support the following conclusions: 1) The brainstem HPC synchronizing pathway originating in the pons region ascends to the medial septum via the midline posterior hypothalamic region; 2) the present results taken together with previous work suggest that a major component of the ascending synchronizing pathway, up to and including the hippocampal formation, is cholinergic, cholinoceptive, or both, and the receptors involved are primarily muscarinic; 3) the midline posterior hypothalamic region is an important source of inputs to the medial septum and their major contribution is to provide frequency-coded inputs to the MS/vDBB for relay into the hippocampal formation.},

The literature might, however, be somewhat unclear, considering the different targets used, and due to repeated inclusion of individual patients in multiple publications. The aim of this report was to review the literature on DBS for OCD. Methods The modern literature concerning studies conducted on DBS in the treatment of OCD was reviewed. Results The results of DBS in OCD have been presented in 25 reports with 130 patients, of which, however, only 90 contained individual patients. Five of these reports included at least 5 individual patients not presented elsewhere. Sixty-eight of these patients underwent implantation in the region of the internal capsule/ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. The target in this region has varied between groups and over time, but the latest results from bilateral procedures in this area have shown a 50\% reduction of OCD scores, depression, and anxiety. The subthalamic nucleus has been suggested as an alternative target. Although beneficial effects have been demonstrated, the efficacy of this procedure cannot be decided, because only results after 3 months of active stimulation have been presented so far. Conclusions DBS is a promising treatment for therapy-refractory OCD, but the published experience is limited and the method is at present an experimental therapy.},

Thereby, species differences need to be considered for recommendations regarding evidence-based severity assessment and refinement measures. Methods A comprehensive analysis of behavioral patterns and corticosterone or its metabolites in serum and feces was completed in kindled mice. The impact of kindling via two different stimulation sites in the amygdala and hippocampus was determined. Data were compared to those from naive and electrode-implanted groups. Results Amygdala and hippocampus kindled mice exhibited comparable behavioral patterns with increased activity in the open field, reduced anxiety-associated behavior in the elevated-plus maze, and increased anhedonia-associated behavior in the saccharin preference test. In addition, repeated stimulation of the hippocampus caused a reduction in burrowing behavior and an increase in active social interaction. Levels of corticosterone and its metabolites were not altered in serum or feces, respectively. A comparison of mouse data with findings from amygdala kindled rats confirmed pronounced species differences in behavioral patterns associated with the kindling process. Significance Taken together the findings suggest a severity classification for the mouse kindling paradigms as moderate regardless of the stimulation site. The outcome of the species comparison provides valuable guidance for species selection for studies exploring behavioral comorbidities. In this context, it is emphasized that the mouse kindling paradigms seem to be well suited for studies exploring the link between ictal events and network alterations on the one hand, and hyperactivity and anhedonia-associated behavior on the other hand. Moreover, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the impact of therapeutic interventions on these behavioral alterations can be studied in these paradigms providing guidance for the clinical management of respective psychiatric comorbidities in patients.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Secondarily generalized tonic\textendash clonic seizure (SGTCS) may occur rarely in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but SGTCS is the major risk factor for sudden death and for seizure-related fatal injuries. Our aim was to investigate clinical factors associated with the occurrence of SGTCS in TLE by addressing two questions: (1) What clinical features differentiate patients with TLE who regularly had SGTCS from those who did not? (2) Is there an association of secondarily generalized seizures with preceding seizure elements and clinical data? Methods: We included 171 patients with TLE (mean age 34.4 {$\pm$} 10) who participated in our presurgical evaluation program, which included continuous video\textendash electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients had a temporal lobectomy as a result of mesial or neocortical TLE. To reevaluate the archived seizures, we selected the consecutively recorded seizures of each patient. If the patient had more than three recorded seizures, then we reevaluated only the first three. Altogether video-recorded seizures of 402 patients were reanalyzed. Key Findings: A positive association between the presence of hippocampal sclerosis on the MRI and SGTCS in the patient history was found, whereas ictal speech and pedal automatism showed a negative association with a SGTCS history. The age of patients showed a positive association, whereas patient's reactivity before and during the seizure, oral/pedal automatisms, and vocalizations showed a negative association with secondary generalization of a focal-onset seizure during video-EEG monitoring. Significance: Clinical features associated with SGTCS may help clinicians during presurgical monitoring identify high-risk patients for SGTCS. Our study may help in understanding the pathophysiology of secondary generalization.},

Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that GABAergic medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178\textdegree ) or the peak (330\textdegree ) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.},

However, whether MS regulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is disrupted in a developmental disruption model of schizophrenia is unknown. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed at gestational day 17 to methylazoxymethanol (MAM) or saline. As adults, NMDA (0.75\,\textmu g/0.2\,\textmu L) was infused into the MS, and either DA neuron activity in the VTA and SNc (7\textendash 9 anesthetized rats per group) or amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH, 11-13 rats per group) was measured. MS activation produced a 58\% increase in the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in VTA and a 37\% decrease in SNc in saline rats. However, MS activation produced opposite effects on DA population activity in MAM rats, decreasing VTA DA activity by 51\% and increasing SNc DA activity by 47\%. MS activation also increased AIH by 113\% in MAM rats, opposite of what is seen in intact rats. The effect in behavioral output may be due to disrupted GABAergic regulation of SNc as bicuculline infusion into vSub, which selectively prevented the MS activation-induced decrease in SNc DA activity in intact rats, prevented the increase in AIH and SNc DA activity in MAM rats. These findings demonstrate that the regulation of midbrain DA neurons by the MS is disrupted in this well-validated animal model, suggesting that it could be a potential locus for pharmacological intervention in disorders such as schizophrenia.},

MS activation increased (71\%) the number of spontaneously active DA neurons in the VTA, and decreased (40\%) the number of active DA neurons in the SNc.

  abstract = {Let sleeping mice remember The role of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep for memory consolidation has been discussed for a long time. Boyce et al. used optogenetics to inhibit theta oscillations in the mouse hippocampus during REM sleep (see the Perspective by Kocsis). Both object recognition memory and contextual fear memory were impaired. This consolidation mechanism occurred in a critical time window immediately after training. Disrupting the same system for similar durations during non-REM sleep or wakefulness had no effect on memory. Science, this issue p. 812; see also p. 770 Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) has been linked with spatial and emotional memory consolidation. However, establishing direct causality between neural activity during REMS and memory consolidation has proven difficult because of the transient nature of REMS and significant caveats associated with REMS deprivation techniques. In mice, we optogenetically silenced medial septum {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid\textendash releasing (MSGABA) neurons, allowing for temporally precise attenuation of the memory-associated theta rhythm during REMS without disturbing sleeping behavior. REMS-specific optogenetic silencing of MSGABA neurons selectively during a REMS critical window after learning erased subsequent novel object place recognition and impaired fear-conditioned contextual memory. Silencing MSGABA neurons for similar durations outside REMS episodes had no effect on memory. These results demonstrate that MSGABA neuronal activity specifically during REMS is required for normal memory consolidation. Selectively disrupting REM sleep impairs hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Selectively disrupting REM sleep impairs hippocampus-dependent memory formation.},

  abstract = {The cellular generation and spatial distribution of gamma frequency (40\textendash{} 100 Hz) activity was examined in the hippocampus of the awake rat. Field potentials and unit activity were recorded by multiple site silicon probes (5- and 16-site shanks) and wire electrode arrays. Gamma waves were highly coherent along the long axis of the dentate hilus, but average coherence decreased rapidly in the CA3 and CA1 directions. Analysis of short epochs revealed large fluctuations in coherence values between the dentate and CA1 gamma waves. Current source density analysis revealed large sinks and sources in the dentate gyrus with spatial distribution similar to the dipoles evoked by stimulation of the perforant path. The frequency changes of gamma and theta waves positively correlated (40\textendash 100 Hz and 5\textendash 10 Hz, respectively). Putative interneurons in the dentate gyrus discharged at gamma frequency and were phase-locked to the ascending part of the gamma waves recorded from the hilus. Following bilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex the power and frequency of hilar gamma activity significantly decreased or disappeared. Instead, a large amplitude but slower gamma pattern (25\textendash 50 Hz) emerged in the CA3-CA1 network. We suggest that gamma oscillation emerges from an interaction between intrinsic oscillatory properties of interneurons and the network properties of the dentate gyrus. We also hypothesize that under physiological conditions the hilar gamma oscillation may be entrained by the entorhinal rhythm and that gamma oscillation in the CA3-CA1 circuitry is suppressed by either the hilar region or the entorhinal cortex.},

Entorhinal grid cells provide a prominent spatial signal to hippocampus, and changes in their firing pattern could thus generate a distinct spatial code in each context. We examined whether we would preclude the emergence of new spatial representations in a novel environment during muscimol inactivation of the medial septal area, a manipulation known to disrupt theta oscillations and grid cell firing. We found that new, highly distinct configurations of place fields emerged immediately and remained stable during the septal inactivation. The new place code persisted when theta oscillations had recovered. Theta rhythmicity and feedforward input from grid cell networks were thus not required to generate new spatial representations in the hippocampus. Video Abstract},

Serial sectioning, sequential staining and double immunofluorescence techniques employing antibodies to glutamate decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase revealed the distribution of these transmitter-specific neurons in the rat. Morphologically, the two types of neurons appear similar, in that they are predominantly large multipolar cells, but they are characterized by different, overlapping distributions in the diagonal band. Glutamate decarboxylase-positive cells are scattered throughout the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, while choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons are more numerous medially and are distributed in groups corresponding to the dorsal and ventral aspects of the nucleus. In the rostral parts of the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, the choline acetyltransferase-positive cells tend to be located medially, whereas caudally they spread dorsal to the nucleus to become continuous with other large cholinergic neurons in the ventral pallidum and sublenticular substantia innominata. The large majority of glutamate decarboxylase-positive neurons remain in a more ventral and lateral position within the nucleus of the horizontal limb and are particularly numerous just lateral to the diagonal band fibers as they join the medial forebrain bundle. Cholinergic neurons were estimated to be about two times more numerous than GABAergic neurons. Approximately 1\% of the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons were also glutamate decarboxylase-positive in double immunofluorescence studies, but not in sequentially stained or serial sections.},

Across many temporal and spatial scales, network neuroscience has emerged as a central focus of intellectual efforts, seeking meaningful descriptions of brain networks and explanatory sets of network features that underlie circuit function in health and dysfunction in disease. However, the tools of network science commonly deployed provide insight into brain function at a fundamentally descriptive level, often failing to identify (patho-)physiological mechanisms that link system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain function. Here we describe recently developed techniques stemming from advances in complex systems and network science that have the potential to overcome this limitation, thereby contributing mechanistic insights into neuroanatomy, functional dynamics, and pathology. Finally, we build on the Research Domain Criteria framework, highlighting the notion that mental illnesses can be conceptualized as dysfunctions of neural circuitry present across conventional diagnostic boundaries, to sketch how network-based methods can be combined with pharmacological, intermediate phenotype, genetic, and magnetic stimulation studies to probe mechanisms of psychopathology.},

This technique also remains under investigation as a specific treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Recently we discovered that VNS induced hippocampal formation (HPC) type II theta rhythm, which is involved in memory consolidation. In the present study, we have extended our previous observation and addressed the neuronal substrate and pharmacological profile of HPC type II theta rhythm induced by VNS in anesthetized rats. Methods Male Wistar rats were implanted with a VNS cuff electrode around the left vagus nerve, a tungsten microelectrode for recording the HPC field activity, and a medial septal (MS) cannula for the injection of a local anesthetic, procaine, and muscarinic agents. A direct, brief effect of VNS on the HPC field potential was evaluated before and after medial-septal drug injection. Results Medial septal injection of local anesthetic, procaine, reversibly abolished VNS-induced HPC theta rhythm. With the use of cholinergic muscarinic agonist and antagonists, we demonstrated that medial septal M1 receptors are involved in the mediation of the VNS effect on HPC theta field potential. Conclusion The MS cholinergic M1 receptor mechanism integrates not only central inputs from the brainstem synchronizing pathway, which underlies the production of HPC type II theta rhythm, but also the input from the vagal afferents in the brain stem.},

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: An international consortium of experts organized, reviewed the literature, and attended the workshop. Topics were introduced at the workshop, followed by group discussion. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A draft of a consensus statement was presented and further edited after plenary debate. The final statements were agreed on by all members. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Patients with PD without significant active cognitive or psychiatric problems who have medically intractable motor fluctuations, intractable tremor, or intolerance of medication adverse effects are good candidates for DBS. (2) Deep brain stimulation surgery is best performed by an experienced neurosurgeon with expertise in stereotactic neurosurgery who is working as part of a interprofessional team. (3) Surgical complication rates are extremely variable, with infection being the most commonly reported complication of DBS. (4) Deep brain stimulation programming is best accomplished by a highly trained clinician and can take 3 to 6 months to obtain optimal results. (5) Deep brain stimulation improves levodopa-responsive symptoms, dyskinesia, and tremor; benefits seem to be long-lasting in many motor domains. (6) Subthalamic nuclei DBS may be complicated by increased depression, apathy, impulsivity, worsened verbal fluency, and executive dysfunction in a subset of patients. (7) Both globus pallidus pars interna and subthalamic nuclei DBS have been shown to be effective in addressing the motor symptoms of PD. (8) Ablative therapy is still an effective alternative and should be considered in a select group of appropriate patients.},

  abstract = {Network hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer' disease (AD) as well as numerous transgenic mouse models of AD. While hyperexcitability in AD patients and AD animal models share certain features, the mechanistic overlap remains to be established. We aimed to identify features of network hyperexcitability in AD models that can be related to epileptiform activity signatures in AD patients. We studied network hyperexcitability in mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations that cause familial AD, and compared a transgenic model that overexpresses human APP (hAPP) (J20), to a knock-in model expressing APP at physiological levels (APPNL/F). We recorded continuous long-term electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity from mice, and studied modulation by circadian cycle, behavioral, and brain state. We report that while J20s exhibit frequent interictal spikes (IISs), APPNL/F mice do not. In J20 mice, IISs were most prevalent during daylight hours and the circadian modulation was associated with sleep. Further analysis of brain state revealed that IIS in J20s are associated with features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We found no evidence of cholinergic changes that may contribute to IIS-circadian coupling in J20s. In contrast to J20s, intracranial recordings capturing IIS in AD patients demonstrated frequent IIS in non-REM (NREM) sleep. The salient differences in sleep-stage coupling of IIS in APP overexpressing mice and AD patients suggests that different mechanisms may underlie network hyperexcitability in mice and humans. We posit that sleep-stage coupling of IIS should be an important consideration in identifying mouse AD models that most closely recapitulate network hyperexcitability in human AD.},

  abstract = {Gamma oscillations (30\textendash 120 Hz) are thought to be important for various cognitive functions, including perception and working memory, and disruption of these oscillations has been implicated in brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus receives gamma frequency inputs from upstream regions (cornu ammonis area 3 and medial entorhinal cortex) and generates itself a faster gamma oscillation. The exact nature and origin of the intrinsic CA1 gamma oscillation is still under debate. Here, we expressed channelrhodopsin-2 under the CaMKII{$\alpha$} promoter in mice and prepared hippocampal slices to produce a model of intrinsic CA1 gamma oscillations. Sinusoidal optical stimulation of CA1 at theta frequency was found to induce robust theta-nested gamma oscillations with a temporal and spatial profile similar to CA1 gamma in vivo. The results suggest the presence of a single gamma rhythm generator with a frequency range of 65\textendash 75 Hz at 32\textdegree C. Pharmacological analysis found that the oscillations depended on both AMPA and GABAA receptors. Cell-attached and whole-cell recordings revealed that excitatory neuron firing slightly preceded interneuron firing within each gamma cycle, suggesting that this intrinsic CA1 gamma oscillation is generated with a pyramidal\textendash interneuron circuit mechanism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study demonstrates that the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) is capable of generating intrinsic gamma oscillations in response to theta input. This gamma generator is independent of activity in the upstream regions, highlighting that CA1 can produce its own gamma oscillation in addition to inheriting activity from the upstream regions. This supports the theory that gamma oscillations predominantly function to achieve local synchrony, and that a local gamma generated in each area conducts the signal to the downstream region.},

  abstract = {Rats implanted with recording and stimulating electrodes were trained to run in an activity wheel for a water reward. Unitary discharges and slow activity were recorded by a movable tungsten microelectrode and by fixed electrodes. Single cells were classified according to their spontaneous and evoked response properties as pyramidal cells, granule cells and interneurons. Unit activity, EEG and their interrelations were studied by spectral and spike-triggered averaging methods. Gradual phase-shifts of RSA were observed both in CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Movement-related RSA was correlated with a decrease in firing rate of pyramidal cells and an increase in the firing of both interneurons and granule cells. In the CA1 region pyramidal cells and interneurons fired preferentially on the negative and positive phases of the locally derived RSA, respectively. In the dentate gyrus both granule cells and interneurons discharged mainly on the positive portion of the local RSA waves, about 90\textdegree{} before the CA1 pyramidal cells. Fourier analysis of the spike trains of interneurons and granule cells showed high power at RSA frequency, coherent with the concurrent EEG. Phase relations between discharges of interneurons and RSA remained unchanged following urethane anesthesia. In waking rats, atropine administration resulted in a decreased discharge of interneurons at RSA frequency, and reduced coherence with RSA. Lesions of the septum or the fimbria-fornix abolished RSA and the rhythmic discharges of the interneurons. Isolation of the entorhinal cortex (EC) from its cortical inputs did not change either EEG or neuronal firing. However, in such a preparation atropine completely abolished RSA and related rhythmicity of interneurons. During drinking and immobility but not during walking, sharp waves (SPW) of about 40\textendash 100 ms duration appeared in the EEG. SPWs were invariably accompanied by synchronous discharges of several pyramidal cells and interneurons. CA3 pyramidal cells also discharged in synchronous bursts but without local SPWs. Laminar profiles of SPWs and the field potentials evoked by stimulation of Schaf fer collaterals were essentially identical. The behavior-dependent occurrence of SPWs was retained following atropine administration, septal lesion or EC isolation but was lost after fimbria-for-nix-neocortex lesion or following atropine administration in EC isolated rats. In addition to relations to RSA and SPWs, interneurons were phase-locked to the fast EEG pattern (25\textendash 70 Hz). This relationship was preserved following lesions of the septum or the fimbria-fornix complex. The above findings allowed us to construct a new model of hippocampal RSA generation based on feed-forward inhibition from the septum and a direct excitation by the entorhinal input. SPWs are suggested to reflect strong synaptic activation of CA1 pyramidal cells via the Schaffer collaterals as a consequence of synchronous discharges of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Fast activity is supposed to reflect synaptic activity close to the somata of pyramidal cells and granule cells.},

What is the frequency range of HFOs? Are there different types of HFOs, physiological and pathological? How are HFOs generated? Can HFOs represent temporal codes for cognitive processes? These questions are pressing and this symposium volume attempts to give constructive answers. As a prelude to this exciting discussion, we summarize the physiological high frequency patterns in the intact brain, concentrating mainly on hippocampal patterns, where the mechanisms of high frequency oscillations are perhaps best understood.},

  abstract = {Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during ``off-line'' states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, ``p-ripples,'' which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the spatial distribution and cellular-synaptic generation of hippocampal sharp waves (SPW) in the dorsal hippocampus of the awake rat. Depth analyses of SPWs were performed by stepping the recording electrode in 82.5 {$\mu$}m increments. SPWs were present during slow wave sleep, awake immobility, drinking, grooming and eating (0.01\textendash 2/s). The largest negative SPWs were recorded from the middle part of the stratum radiatum of CA1, the stratum lucidum of CA3, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and from layer I of the subiculum, in that order. The polarity of the SPWs was positive in layers II\textendash IV of the subiculum, in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3, and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The electrical gradients across the null zones of the field SPWs were as large as 8\textendash 14 mV/mm. SPWs were associated with population bursts of pyramidal cells and increased discharges of interneurons and granule cells. During the SPW the excitability of granule cells and pyramidal cells to afferent volleys increased considerably. Picrotoxin and atropine and aspiration lesion of the fimbria-fornix increased either the amplitude or the frequency of SPWs. Diazepam and Nembutal could completely abolish SPWs. It is suggested that: (1) hippocampal SPWs are triggered by a population burst of CA3 pyramidal cells as a result of temporary disinhibition from afferent control; and (2) field SPWs represent summed extracellular PSPs of CA1 and subicular pyramidal cells, and dentate granular cells induced by the Schaffer collaterals and the associational fibers of hilar cells, respectively. The relevance of the physiological SPWs to epileptic interictal and long-term potentiation is discussed.},

  abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the ``operational modes'' of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.},

This chapter discusses the possible mechanisms of electrophysiological recovery in the damaged septohippocampal system following transplantation of solid pieces or suspensions of fetal brain tissue into the lesion cavity or into the hippocampus, and the epileptogenic properties of hippocampal grafts. The experiments, using the septohippocampal model to study the mechanisms of action of brain grafts, suggest that a likely mechanism of restoration of physiological activity of the deafferented hippocampus is a passive bridging action of the graft between the host septum and hippocampus. The chapter demonstrates the reciprocal physiological and anatomical connections between the graft and host, and shows that hippocampal grafts can serve as an implanted epileptic focus, which may further worsen the function of the already damaged brain. However, experiments are required that determine why under certain conditions the grafts produce epileptic activity, while under seemingly similar conditions they lead to the restoration of physiological function of damaged brain circuitries.},

Thereby, it critically determines contextual setting and specificity of episodic memories. It is also a key site for the control of innate anxiety states and involved in psychiatric diseases with heightened anxiety and generalized fear memory such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Expression of both innate ``unlearned'' anxiety and ``learned'' fear requires contextual processing and engagement of a brain-wide network including the hippocampus together with the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. Strikingly, the hippocampus is also the site of emergence of oscillatory rhythms that coordinate information processing and filtering in this network. Here, we review data on how the hippocampal network oscillations and their coordination with amygdalar and prefrontal oscillations are engaged in innate threat evaluation. We further explore how such innate oscillatory communication might have an impact on contextualization and specificity of ``learned'' fear. We illustrate the partial overlap of fear and anxiety networks that are built by the hippocampus in conjunction with amygdala and prefrontal cortex. We further propose that (mal)-adaptive interplay via (dis)-balanced oscillatory communication between the anxiety network and the fear network may determine the strength of fear memories and their resistance to extinction.},

Unlike most medications for the treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The effects of ibogaine\textemdash like those of other psychedelic compounds\textemdash are long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine, including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine, and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog\textemdash a water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has therapeutic potential.},

  abstract = {Cocaine is known to increase brain dopamine at supranormal levels in comparison to alternative nondrug rewards. According to the dopamine hypothesis of addiction, this abnormally large dopamine response would explain why cocaine use is initially highly rewarding and addictive. Though resting on solid neuroscientific foundations, this hypothesis has nevertheless proven difficult to reconcile with research on cocaine choice in experimental animals. When facing a choice between an intravenous bolus of cocaine and a nondrug alternative (e.g., sweet water), both delivered immediately after choice, rats do not choose the drug, as would be predicted, but instead develop a strong preference for the nondrug alternative. Here we report evidence that reconciles this finding with the dopamine hypothesis of addiction. First, a systematic literature analysis revealed that the delays of effects of intravenous cocaine on nucleus accumbens dopamine are of the order of tens of seconds and are considerably longer than those of nondrug reward. Second, this was confirmed by measuring response times to cocaine omission during self-administration as a behavioral proxy of these delays. Finally, when the influence of the drug delays was reduced during choice by adding an increasing delay to both the drug and nondrug rewards, rats shifted their choice to cocaine. Overall, this study suggests that cocaine is indeed supranormal in reward magnitude, as postulated by the dopamine hypothesis of addiction, but is less preferred during choice because its pharmacokinetics makes it an inherently more delayed reward than the alternative. Reframing previous drug choice studies in rats as intertemporal choice studies reveals that the discounting effects of delays spare no rewards, including supranormal ones, and that during choice, pharmacokinetics trumps pharmacodynamics.},

Importantly, whereas high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC might thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Site-specific genetic and epigenetic targeting of distinct cell populations is a central goal in molecular neuroscience and is crucial to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex phenotypes and behaviors. While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customizations for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of CRISPR-based systems have transformed this aspect of genome editing, providing a variety of possible applications and targets. However, there are currently few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. Here, we optimized a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system for Cre recombinase-dependent, cell type-specific targeting. Unexpectedly, CRISPR systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction in the absence of Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in both HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate highly inducible genes (GRM2 and Tent5b) as well as moderately inducible genes (Sstr2 and Gadd45b) in a Cre-specific manner. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and will enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for nearly 70\% of the more than 46 million dementia cases estimated worldwide. Although there is no cure for AD, early diagnosis and an accurate characterization of the disease progression can improve the quality of life of AD patients and their caregivers. Currently, AD diagnosis is carried out using standardized mental status examinations, which are commonly assisted by expensive neuroimaging scans and invasive laboratory tests, thus rendering the diagnosis time consuming and costly. Notwithstanding, over the last decade, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a noninvasive alternative technique for the study of AD, competing with more expensive neuroimaging tools, such as MRI and PET. This paper reports on the results of a systematic review on the utilization of resting-state EEG signals for AD diagnosis and progression assessment. Recent journal articles obtained from four major bibliographic databases were analyzed. A total of 112 journal articles published from January 2010 to February 2018 were meticulously reviewed, and relevant aspects of these papers were compared across articles to provide a general overview of the research on this noninvasive AD diagnosis technique. Finally, recommendations for future studies with resting-state EEG were presented to improve and facilitate the knowledge transfer among research groups.},

  abstract = {The septal region of the brain consists of a heterogeneous population of GABAergic neurons that play an important role in the generation of hippocampal theta rhythms. While GABAergic neurons employ two isoforms of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) for the synthesis of GABA, distribution of GAD isoforms has not been investigated in the septum. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to investigate the expression of GAD enzymes in medial and lateral septum. GAD65 and GAD67 immunohistochemistry revealed dense fibers and punctuated immunoreactivity in septal regions. While few GAD65-positive neuronal somas were detected in medial septum, a significantly higher number of immunoreactive neurons were detected in lateral septum. GAD65- and GAD67-positive neurons in the lateral septum exhibit higher complexity of dendritic arborizations than in the medial septum where staining was mainly restricted to the soma. Presumptive axon terminals (puncta) showed abundant immunoreactivity predominantly for GAD65 isoforms in all septal regions. This suggests that septal GABAergic neurons differentially express GAD enzymes thereby potentially reflecting functional differences. Differences found between medial and lateral septal GABAergic neuronal populations are in agreement with the concept that medial and lateral septum are brain structures with highly different connectivity and function despite anatomical proximity.},

  abstract = {Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity\textemdash using dendritic spines as proxies\textemdash of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting Arc as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express Arc have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.},

  abstract = {Prefrontal-subcortical circuits support executive functions which often become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders. Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant that is currently used in the clinic to treat major depressive disorder. Mechanisms of action of vortioxetine include serotonin (5-HT) transporter blockade, 5-HT1A receptor agonism, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonism, and 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism. Vortioxetine facilitates 5-HT transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), however the impact of this compound on related prefrontal-subcortical circuits is less clear. Thus, the current study examined the impact of systemic vortioxetine administration (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) on spontaneous spiking and spikes evoked by electrical stimulation of the mPFC in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (msNAc), and lateral septal nucleus (LSN) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We also examined whether vortioxetine modulated afferent drive in the msNAc from hippocampal fimbria (HF) inputs. Similar studies were performed using the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (1.6 mg/kg, i.v.) to enable comparisons between the multimodal actions of vortioxetine and SSRI-mediated effects. No significant differences in spontaneous activity were observed in the ACC, msNAc, and LSN across treatment groups. No significant impact of treatment on mPFC-evoked responses was observed in the ACC. In contrast, vortioxetine decreased mPFC-evoked activity recorded in the msNAc as compared to parallel studies in control and escitalopram treated groups. Thus, vortioxetine may reduce mPFC-msNAc afferent drive via a mechanism that, in addition to an SSRI-like effect, requires 5-HT receptor modulation. Recordings in the LSN revealed a significant increase in mPFC-evoked activity following escitalopram administration as compared to control and vortioxetine treated groups, indicating that complex modulation of 5-HT receptors by vortioxetine may offset SSRI-like effects in this region. Lastly, neurons in the msNAc were more responsive to stimulation of the HF following both vortioxetine and escitalopram administration, indicating that elevation of 5-HT tone and 5-HT receptor modulation may facilitate excitatory hippocampal synaptic drive in this region. The above findings point to complex 5-HT receptor-dependent effects of vortioxetine which may contribute to its unique impact on the function of prefrontal-subcortical circuits and the development of novel strategies for treating mood disorders.},

Using a combination of two-photon laser scanning photostimulation and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in mice hippocampal slices, we examined the properties of transmission at GABAergic synapses formed onto hippocampal CA1 stratum oriens \textendash{} lacunosum moleculare (O\textendash LM) interneurons by two major inhibitory inputs: local projection originating from stratum radiatum interneurons and septohippocampal GABAergic terminals. Optical mapping of local inhibitory inputs to O\textendash LM interneurons revealed that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- and calretinine-positive neurons, with anatomical properties typical of type III interneuron-specific interneurons, provided the major local source of inhibition to O\textendash LM cells. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents evoked by minimal stimulation of this input exhibited small amplitude and significant paired-pulse and multiple-pulse depression during repetitive activity. Moreover, these synapses failed to show any form of long-term synaptic plasticity. In contrast, synapses formed by septohippocampal projection produced higher amplitude and persistent inhibition and exhibited long-term potentiation induced by theta-like activity. These results indicate the input and target-specific segregation in inhibitory control, exerted by two types of GABAergic projections and responsible for distinct dynamics of inhibition in O\textendash LM interneurons. The two inputs are therefore likely to support the differential activity- and brain state-dependent recruitment of hippocampal feedback inhibitory circuits in vivo, crucial for dendritic disinhibition and computations in CA1 pyramidal cells.},

Previous work has shown that a modification of the procedure to allow continual trials testing (in which many trials are run concurrently in a single session) decreases behavioural noise and thus significantly reduces the numbers of rats required to retain statistical power. Here we demonstrate for the first time that this improved method of testing extends to mice, increasing the overall power of the approach. Moreover, our results show that the new continual trials approach provides the additional benefits of heightened sensitivity and thus provides greater insight into the mechanisms at play. Standard (c57) and transgenic Alzheimer model (TASTPM) mice were tested both at 7 and 10 months of age in both object recognition (OR) and object location (OL) spontaneous recognition tasks using the continual trials methodology. Both c57 and TASTPM mice showed age-dependent changes in performance in OR. While c57 mice also showed age-related changes in performance of OL, TASTPM mice were unable to perform OL at either age. Significantly, we demonstrate that differences in OL performance in c57s and TASTPM animals is a result of proactive interference rather than an absolute inability to recognise object-location combinations. We argue that these continual trials approaches provide overall improved reliability and better interpretation of the memory ability of mice, as well as providing a significant reduction in overall animal use.},

We report data from a safety study (NCT04042922) and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in participants with probable mild AD dementia after 3 months of one-hour daily 40Hz light and sound GENUS (NCT04055376) to assess safety, compliance, entrainment and possible effects on brain structure, function, sleep and cognitive function. GENUS was well-tolerated and compliance was high in both groups. Electroencephalography recordings show that our GENUS device safely and effectively induced 40Hz entrainment in cognitively normal subjects and participants with mild AD. After 3 months of daily stimulation, participants with mild AD in the 40Hz GENUS group showed less ventricular enlargement and stabilization of the hippocampal size compared to the control group. Functional connectivity increased in both the default mode network and the medial visual network after 3 months of stimulation. Circadian rhythmicity also improved with GENUS. Compared to controls, the active group performed better on the face-name association delayed recall test. These results suggest that 40Hz GENUS can be used safely at home daily and shows favorable outcomes on cognitive function, daily rhythms, and structural and functional MRI biomarkers of AD-related degeneration.

  abstract = {Abstract Brain stimulation techniques can modulate cognitive functions in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Pilot studies have shown promising effects of brain stimulations on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain stimulations can be categorized into non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and invasive brain stimulation (IBS). IBS includes deep brain stimulation (DBS), and invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), whereas NIBS includes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), cranial electrostimulation (CES), and non-invasive VNS. We reviewed the cutting-edge research on these brain stimulation techniques and discussed their therapeutic effects on AD. Both IBS and NIBS may have potential to be developed as novel treatments for AD; however, mixed findings may result from different study designs, patients selection, population or samples sizes. Therefore, the efficacy of NIBS and IBS in AD remains uncertain, and needs to be further investigated. Moreover, more standardized study designs with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up are warranted for establishing a structural guide for future studies and clinical application.},

  abstract = {NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity has been proposed to be important for encoding of memories. Consistent with this hypothesis, the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, has been found to impair performance on tests of memory. Interpretation of some of these findings has, however, been complicated by the fact that the drug-state of animals has differed during encoding and tests of memory. Therefore, it is possible that MK-801 may result in state-dependent retrieval or expression of memory rather than actually impairing encoding itself. We tested this hypothesis in mice using tests of object recognition memory with a 24-hour delay between the encoding and test phase. Mice received injections of either vehicle or MK-801 prior to the encoding phase and the test phase. In Experiment 1, a low dose of MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg) impaired performance when the drug-state (vehicle or MK-801) of mice changed between encoding and test, but there was no significant effect of MK-801 on encoding. In Experiment 2, a higher dose of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) failed to impair object recognition memory when mice received the drug prior to both encoding and test compared to mice that received vehicle. MK-801 did not affect object exploration, but it did induce locomotor hyperactivity at the higher dose. These results suggest that some previous demonstrations of MK-801 effects may reflect a failure to express or retrieve memory due to the state-dependency of memory rather than impaired encoding of memory.},

The lateral septum (LS) has been implicated in the generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, but its precise role in this process is not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of direct pharmacological inhibition or disinhibition of the dorsal LS (dLS) on the frequency of hippocampal theta activity elicited by stimulation of the reticular formation in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that bilateral infusions of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol into the dLS significantly increased theta frequency. Strikingly, intra-dLS infusions of the GABAA receptor antagonist GABAzine largely abolished reticularly elicited theta activity. We also locally injected these same compounds into the medial septum (MS) to test for neuroanatomical specificity. In contrast to the effects seen in the dLS, intra-MS infusions of muscimol had no effect on theta frequency, whereas intra-MS infusions of GABAzine increased theta frequency. Given the hypothesized role of hippocampal theta in behavioral defense, we also examined the effects of intra-dLS application of muscimol in two models of anxiety, the elevated plus maze and the novelty-induced suppression of feeding paradigm; both tests revealed clear, anxiolytic-like effects following muscimol infusions. The fact that dLS-muscimol increased theta frequency while also reducing anxiety-like behaviors challenges the influential theta suppression model of anxiolysis, which predicts a slowing of theta with anxiolytic compounds. More importantly, the experiments reveal a novel role of the LS, especially its dorsal aspects, as an important gating mechanism for the expression of theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus.},

Optogenetics normally requires the use of a blue laser inserted into the brain. Chen et al. used specialized nanoparticles that can upconvert near-infrared light from outside the brain into the local emission of blue light (see the Perspective by Feliu et al.). They injected these nanoparticles into the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain and activated channelrhodopsin expressed in dopaminergic neurons with near-infrared light generated outside the skull at a distance of several millimeters. This technique allowed distant near-infrared light to evoke fast increases in dopamine release. The method was also used successfully to evoke fear memories in the dentate gyrus during fear conditioning. Science, this issue p. 679; see also p. 633 Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.

This study is a largely pictorial description of the deep fiber tracts in the brain using track-density images obtained with 7.0-T diffusion-weighted imaging. Methods To identify the fiber tracts, we selected 3 sets of tractograms and performed interaxis correlation between them. These tractograms offered an opportunity to extract new information in areas that have previously been difficult to examine using either in vivo or in vitro human brain tractography. Results With this new technique, we identified 4 fiber tracts that have not previously been directly visualized in vivo: septum pellucidum tract, anterior thalamic radiation, superolateral medial forebrain bundle, and inferomedial forebrain bundle. Conclusions We present the high-resolution images as a tool for researchers and clinicians working with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and depression, in which the accurate positioning of deep brain stimulation is essential for precise targeting of nuclei and fiber tracts.},

The MHb receives GABAergic input from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB), yet the synaptic mechanism that regulates MHb activity is unclear. GABA ({$\gamma$} -aminobutyric acid) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter activating both GABAA receptors and GABAB receptors. Depending on intracellular chloride concentration, however, GABAA receptors also function in an excitatory manner. In the absence of various synaptic inputs, we found that MHb neurons displayed spontaneous tonic firing at a rate of about \textasciitilde 4.4\,Hz. Optogenetic stimulation of MS/DB inputs to the MHb evoked GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, which produced stimulus-locked neuronal firing. Subsequent delayed yet lasting activation of GABAB receptors attenuated the intrinsic tonic firing. Consequently, septal GABAergic input alone orchestrates both excitatory GABAA and inhibitory GABAB receptors, thereby entraining the firing of MHb neurons.},

These oscillations are important in memory functions and depend on distinct subtypes of hippocampal interneurons such as somatostatin-positive (SST) and parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. Here, we investigated whether A{$\beta$}O causes dysfunctions in SST and PV interneurons by optogenetically manipulating them during theta and gamma oscillations in vivo in A{$\beta$}O-injected SST-Cre or PV-Cre mice. Hippocampal in vivo multi-electrode recordings revealed that optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing SST and PV interneurons in A{$\beta$}O-injected mice selectively restored A{$\beta$}O-induced reduction of the peak power of theta and gamma oscillations, respectively, and resynchronized CA1 pyramidal cell (PC) spikes. Moreover, SST and PV interneuron spike phases were resynchronized relative to theta and gamma oscillations, respectively. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA1 PC in ex vivo hippocampal slices from A{$\beta$}O-injected mice revealed that optogenetic activation of SST and PV interneurons enhanced spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) selectively at theta and gamma frequencies, respectively. Furthermore, analyses of the stimulus\textendash response curve, paired-pulse ratio, and short-term plasticity of SST and PV interneuron-evoked IPSCs ex vivo showed that A{$\beta$}O increased the initial GABA release probability to depress SST/PV interneuron's inhibitory input to CA1 PC selectively at theta and gamma frequencies, respectively. Our results reveal frequency-specific and interneuron subtype-specific presynaptic dysfunctions of SST and PV interneurons' input to CA1 PC as the synaptic mechanisms underlying A{$\beta$}O-induced impairments of hippocampal network oscillations and identify them as potential therapeutic targets for restoring hippocampal network oscillations in early AD.},

Full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endocytosed from the cell surface into endosomes where it is cleaved to produce Ab. Ab is subsequently released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF). We hypothesized that synaptic transmission results in more APP endocytosis, thereby increasing Ab generation and release into the ISF. We found that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis immediately lowers ISF Ab levels in vivo. Two distinct methods that increased synaptic transmission resulted in an elevation of ISF Ab levels. Inhibition of endocytosis, however, prevented the activity-dependent increase in Ab. We estimate that \$70\% of ISF Ab arises from endocytosis-associated mechanisms, with the vast majority of this pool also dependent on synaptic activity. These findings have implications for AD pathogenesis and may provide insights into therapeutic intervention.},

This study examined whether potential infection due to an increasing bacterial inoculum can be prevented or controlled by increasing antimicrobial doses. In an initial set of experiments, Sprague-Dawley rats were given various doses of cefazolin (15, 30, 60, 120 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, then serum and tissue levels were quantified. Serum and tissue drug concentrations correlated with the dose given. In another set of experiments, rats were given doses of either 0, 30 (standard dose), 60, or 120 mg/kg of cefazolin 30 min prior to subcutaneous inoculation of various doses of Staphylococcus aureus. After 6 days, inoculum sites were examined for abscess formation and size. At low levels of contamination, increasing in antibiotic dose to 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg, abscess formation was eliminated at 50, 80, and 92\% of inoculum sites, respectively. At moderate levels of contamination, abscesses formed at all inoculum sites, but abscess size was significantly smaller as the dose increased. When a high inoculum of S. aureus was given, large doses of antibiotics provided no additional benefit. These data suggest that the risk of infection in this model of experimental infection is significantly related to the size of the bacterial inoculum. Increasing the dose of an effective antimicrobial increases drug concentration at the site of contamination and reduces the risk of infection. Administration of higher doses of prophylactic antimicrobials may be more effective when larger amounts of bacterial contamination are anticipated.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder is characterized by exaggerated threat response, and theoretical accounts to date have focused on impaired threat processing and dysregulated prefrontal-cortex-amygdala circuitry. Nevertheless, evidence is accruing for broad, threat-neutral sensory hyperactivity in post-traumatic stress disorder. As low-level, sensory processing impacts higher-order operations, such sensory anomalies can contribute to widespread dysfunctions, presenting an additional aetiological mechanism for post-traumatic stress disorder. To elucidate a sensory pathology of post-traumatic stress disorder, we examined intrinsic visual cortical activity (based on posterior alpha oscillations) and bottom-up sensory-driven causal connectivity (Granger causality in the alpha band) during a resting state (eyes open) and a passive, serial picture viewing state. Compared to patients with generalized anxiety disorder (n = 24) and healthy control subjects (n = 20), patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 25) demonstrated intrinsic sensory hyperactivity (suppressed posterior alpha power, source-localized to the visual cortex\textemdash cuneus and precuneus) and bottom-up inhibition deficits (reduced posterior\textrightarrow frontal Granger causality). As sensory input increased from resting to passive picture viewing, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder failed to demonstrate alpha adaptation, highlighting a rigid, set mode of sensory hyperactivity. Interestingly, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder also showed heightened frontal processing (augmented frontal gamma power, source-localized to the superior frontal gyrus and dorsal cingulate cortex), accompanied by attenuated top\textendash down inhibition (reduced frontal\textrightarrow posterior causality). Importantly, not only did suppressed alpha power and bottom-up causality correlate with heightened frontal gamma power, they also correlated with increased severity of sensory and executive dysfunctions (i.e. hypervigilance and impulse control deficits, respectively). Therefore, sensory aberrations help construct a vicious cycle in post-traumatic stress disorder that is in action even at rest, implicating dysregulated triangular sensory-prefrontal-cortex-amygdala circuitry: intrinsic sensory hyperactivity and disinhibition give rise to frontal overload and disrupt executive control, fuelling and perpetuating post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Absent in generalized anxiety disorder, these aberrations highlight a unique sensory pathology of post-traumatic stress disorder (ruling out effects merely reflecting anxious hyperarousal), motivating new interventions targeting sensory processing and the sensory brain in these patients.},

Coordinated firing by widely distributed cells is required to produce an oscillation, but this network activity can be quite variable. It is not clear why gamma oscillations should differ so greatly across time and space. New evidence reveals that information trafficking within the hippocampus and parts of temporal cortex is dependent upon the speed of gamma. Faster oscillations link entorhinal cortex to CA1, providing information on the animal's location, while slower oscillations link CA1 to CA3 for information storage. Thus, one possible function underlying a variable gamma is to properly route information within a circuit.},

  abstract = {Application of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine to conventional hippocampal slices caused a significant reduction of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) elicited by single pulse stimulation to the medial perforant path. Similar but smaller effects were obtained in the lateral perforant path and other excitatory pathways within hippocampus. The reductions were blocked by atropine, were not accompanied by evident changes in the EPSP waveform, and were eliminated by lesions to the cholinergic septo-hippocampal projections. Antidromic responses to mossy fiber stimulation, recorded in stratum granulosum, were not affected by the drug. However, paired-pulse facilitation was reliably increased, indicating that the depressed synaptic responses were secondary to reductions in transmitter release. The absence of cholinergic axo-axonic connections in the molecular layer suggests that physostigmine reduces presynaptic release by increasing retrograde signaling from the granule cells. In accord with this, an antagonist of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor eliminated the effects of physostigmine on synaptic responses, while an antagonist of the presynaptically located m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor did not. This is in contrast to previously reported effects involving application of cholinergic agonists, in which presynaptic inhibition likely results from direct activation of presynaptically located muscarinic receptors. In summary, it is proposed that the cholinergic inputs from the septum to the middle molecular layer modulate, via endocannabinoid release, the potency of the primary excitatory afferent of hippocampus.},

The existence of noncholinergic, non-GABAergic, most likely glutamatergic septal neurons has recently been reported. However, their morphological characteristics, numbers, distribution, and connectivity have not been determined. Furthermore, the projection of septal glutamatergic neurons to the hippocampus has not been characterized. To address these issues, subpopulations of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was injected into the hippocampus to determine the characteristics of a glutamatergic septo-hippocampal projection. Our work revealed that although glutamatergic neurons are found throughout the septum, they concentrate in medial septal regions. Using stereological probes, approximately 16,000 glutamatergic neurons were estimated in the medial septal region. Triple immunostaining showed that most glutamatergic neurons do not immunoreact with cholinergic or GABAergic neuronal markers (anti-ChAT or anti-GAD67 antibodies, respectively). Fluorogold injections into CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that septal glutamatergic neurons project to each of these hippocampal regions, forming approximately 23\% of the septo-hippocampal projection. Most cell bodies of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic neurons were located in the medial septum. The remaining cell bodies were found in the diagonal band. This data shows that glutamatergic neurons constitute a significant neuronal population in the septum and that a subpopulation of these neurons projects to hippocampal regions. Thus, the septo-hippocampal projection needs to be reconsidered as a three neurotransmitter pathway.},

The septum modulates the activity of hippocampal and cortical circuits and is crucial to the initiation and occurrence of oscillatory activities such as the hippocampal theta rhythm. Previous studies suggest that amyloid {$\beta$} peptide (A{$\beta$}) accumulation may trigger degeneration in AD. This study evaluates the effects of single injections of A{$\beta$} 1-40 into the medial septum. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease in septal cholinergic (57\%) and glutamatergic (53\%) neurons in A{$\beta$} 1-40 treated tissue. Additionally, glutamatergic terminals were significantly less in A{$\beta$} treated tissue. In contrast, septal GABAergic neurons were spared. Unitary recordings from septal neurons and hippocampal field potentials revealed an approximately 50\% increase in firing rates of slow firing septal neurons during theta rhythm and large irregular amplitude (LIA) hippocampal activities and a significantly reduced hippocampal theta rhythm power (49\%) in A{$\beta$} 1-40 treated tissue. A{$\beta$} also markedly reduced the proportion of slow firing septal neurons correlated to the hippocampal theta rhythm by 96\%. These results confirm that A{$\beta$} alters the anatomy and physiology of the medial septum contributing to septo-hippocampal dysfunction. The A{$\beta$} induced injury of septal cholinergic and glutamatergic networks may contribute to an altered hippocampal theta rhythm which may underlie the memory loss typically observed in AD patients.},

Medial septal neurons were simultaneously recorded with hippocampal field potentials to investigate the septo-hippocampal function in the pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy. The theta rhythm from chronically epileptic rats had lower amplitude (20\% less) and higher frequency than controls (from 3.38 to 4.25 Hz), suggesting that both generator and pacemaker structures are affected during the epileptic process. At the cellular level, the group of rhythmically bursting firing medial septal neurons, in the epileptic animals, significantly and chronically increased their firing rates in relation to controls (from 13.86 to 29.14 spikes/s). Peristimulus histograms performed around hippocampal sharp waves showed that all high-frequency firing neurons, including rhythmically bursting neurons and most slow firing neurons, decreased firing rates immediately after hippocampal epileptic discharges. Thus inhibitory hippocampo-septal influences prevail during hippocampal epileptic discharges. The occurrence of epileptic discharges was reduced 86\textendash 97\% of the number observed during spontaneous theta and theta induced by sensory (tail pinch) or chemical stimulation (carbachol), suggesting that the presence of the theta state regardless of how it was produced was responsible for the reduction in epileptic discharge frequency. The understanding of the theta rhythm ``anti-epileptic'' effect at the cellular and molecular levels may result in novel therapeutic approaches dedicated to protect the brain against abnormal excitability states.},

  abstract = {In their laboratory the authors have previously demonstrated that hippocampal slices could be induced to generate trains of ``theta-like'' oscillations by whole-bath perfusions of carbachol. Until recently, it has not been possible to generate similar activity in the septally deafferented hippocampus of an otherwise intact brain by microinfusions of carbachol. This study presents a full report of the first demonstration of a theta-like oscillation in the in vivo, septally deafferented hippocampal formation. Rats were anesthetized with urethane and implanted with microinfusion cannulae in the region of the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/vDBB) and at single or multiple sites in the stratum moleculare of the fascia dentata. The MS/vDBB was microinfused with procaine hydrochloride to produce a reversible suppression lasting for approximately 20 minutes. Intrahippocampal microinfusions of carbachol or bicuculline alone (in the postprocaine condition of the MS/vDBB) failed to produce any theta-like oscillations. The combination of carbachol and bicuculline produced trains of theta-like oscillations during suppression of the MS/vDBB very similar to those seen in the slice preparations. The oscillations were blocked by intravenous administration of atropine sulfate, and they had the same depth profile as that of theta. Theta-on cells were shown to discharge in rhythmic bursts in synchrony with the oscillations. Thus, it would appear that the essential nature of the medial septal input to the hippocampal formation, for the generation of theta field activity in the intact brain, consists of a critical balance between cholinergic and GABAergic circuitry.},

In all major respects the two techniques gave the same results. The majority of the ascending projections sweep ventrally from the raphe nuclei, then curve rostrally to course through the ventral tegmentum and into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Others radiate through the mesencephalic reticular formation (RF) and central grey, turning ventrally at the posterior thalamic border to enter the subthalamus. From the MFB, fibers branch into the hypothalamus, preoptic areas, anterior amygdala and olfactory tubercle, while some fibers enter the fornix or the stria terminalis. Many fibers continue rostrally in the MFB, joining the diagonal bands of Broca to reach the septal nuclei or, further rostrally, the cingulum bundle. Fibers in the cingulum bundle turn caudally around the genu of the corpus callosum, some branching into the cell-free layers of the pregenual cortex. Runing caudally, then curving around the splenium, the cingulum bundle projection sprays out into the subiculum and in some cases a projection into the hippocampus is seen. Other ascending projections include one to the habenular nuclei through the fasciculus retroflexus. Projections to the mediodorsal, parafascicular and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus were also noted. Descending projections were observed to the dorsal tegmental nucleus and locus coeruleus and diffusely to the pontine reticular formation and caudal central grey. No projections were seen below the level of the facial nerve nucleus and none were observed to the cerebellum, caudal raphe nuclei or cranial nerve nuclei.},

The classical hydration of thin lipid films in an organic solvent is applied herein as a technique to encapsulate tarin, a plant lectin, in nanoliposomes. Nanoliposome size, stability, entrapment efficiency, and morphological characterization are described in detail. The nanoliposomes are prepared using 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt; DSPE-MPEG 2000), and cholesterylhemisuccinate (CHEMS) as the main constituents. Lipids are first dissolved in chloroform to obtain a thin lipid film that is subsequently rehydrated in ammonium sulfate solution containing the protein to be entrapped and incubated overnight. Then, sonication and extrusion techniques are applied to generate nanosized unilamellar vesicles. The size and polydispersity index of the nanovesicles are determined by dynamic light scattering, while nanovesicle morphology is assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Entrapment efficiency is determined by the ratio of the amount of unencapsulated protein to original amount of initially loaded protein. Homogeneous liposomes are obtained with an average size of 155 nm and polydispersity index value of 0.168. A high entrapment efficiency of 83\% is achieved.},

  abstract = {Background Up to 80\% of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) are resistant to pharmacological treatment, often necessitating surgical resection. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients who do not qualify for resective brain surgery. Brain stimulation may also exert disease-modifying effects, and noncoding microRNAs have recently been proposed to shape the gene expression landscape in epilepsy. Objective We compared the effect of DBS of 4 different hippocampal target regions on epileptogenesis and manifest epilepsy in a rat model of mTLE-HS. To explore mechanisms, we profiled the effect of the most effective DBS paradigm on hippocampal microRNA levels. Methods MTLE-HS was induced by electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway (PP) in rats. This paradigm leads to spontaneous seizures within 4 weeks. We investigated DBS of 4 targets: PP, fimbria fornix (FF) formation, dentate gyrus (DG) and ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC). We applied both high- (130 Hz) and low-frequency (5 Hz or 1 Hz) stimulation. Functional microRNAs were identified in the hippocampus immediately after VHC-DBS and after a 97-day recording period by sequencing small RNAs bound to Argonaute-2, a component of the miRNA silencing complex. Results Low frequency DBS of the VHC significantly delayed the occurrence of the first spontaneous recurrent seizure in the PPS model by {$\sim$}300\%, from 19 to 56 days. No other stimulation regime altered the latency phase. Upregulation of 5 microRNAs during epileptogenesis was suppressed by VHC-stimulation. Conclusion We conclude that DBS of the VHC delays epilepsy in the PPS model in rats and is associated with differential regulation of several miRNAs. Additional studies are required to determine whether VHC-regulated miRNAs serve causal roles in the anti-epileptogenic effects of this DBS model.},

  abstract = {The basal forebrain (BF) is an important regulator of hippocampal and cortical activity. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a significant loss and dysfunction of cholinergic neurons within the BF, and also a hypertrophy of fibers containing the neuropeptide galanin. Understanding how galanin interacts with BF circuitry is critical in determining what role galanin overexpression plays in the progression of AD. Here, we examined the location and function of galanin in the medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DBB) region of the BF. We show that galanin fibers are located throughout the MS/DBB and intermingled with both cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from MS/DBB neurons in acute slices reveal that galanin decreases tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous GABA release and dampens muscarinic receptor-mediated increases in GABA release in the MS/DBB. These effects are not blocked by pre-exposure to {$\beta$}-amyloid peptide (A{$\beta$}1\textendash 42). Optogenetic activation of cholinergic neurons in the MS/DBB increases GABA release back onto cholinergic neurons, forming a functional circuit within the MS/DBB. Galanin disrupts this cholinergic-GABAergic circuit by blocking the cholinergic-induced increase in GABA release. These data suggest that galanin works in the BF to reduce inhibitory input onto cholinergic neurons and to prevent cholinergic-induced increase in inhibitory tone. This disinhibition of cholinergic neurons could serve as a compensatory mechanism to counteract the loss of cholinergic signaling that occurs during the progression of AD.},

  abstract = {Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment choice for Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor and movement disorders, its effectiveness for the management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unclear. Herein, we conducted an integrative review on major neuroanatomical targets of DBS pursued for the treatment of intractable TRD. The aim of this review article is to provide a critical discussion of possible underlying mechanisms for DBS-generated antidepressant effects identified in preclinical studies and clinical trials, and to determine which brain target(s) elicited the most promising outcomes considering acute and maintenance treatment of TRD. Major electronic databases were searched to identify preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated the effects of DBS on depression-related outcomes. Overall, 92 references met inclusion criteria, and have evaluated six unique DBS targets namely the subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral capsule/ventral striatum or anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC), medial forebrain bundle (MFB), lateral habenula (LHb) and inferior thalamic peduncle for the treatment of unrelenting TRD. Electrical stimulation of these pertinent brain regions displayed differential effects on mood transition in patients with TRD. In addition, 47 unique references provided preclinical evidence for putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying antidepressant effects of DBS applied to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, NAc, MFB, LHb and subthalamic nucleus. Preclinical studies suggest that stimulation parameters and neuroanatomical locations could influence DBS-related antidepressant effects, and also pointed that modulatory effects on monoamine neurotransmitters in target regions or interconnected brain networks following DBS could have a role in the antidepressant effects of DBS. Among several neuromodulatory targets that have been investigated, DBS in the neuroanatomical framework of the SCG, ALIC and MFB yielded more consistent antidepressant response rates in samples with TRD. Nevertheless, more well-designed randomized double-blind, controlled trials are warranted to further assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of these more promising DBS targets for the management of TRD as therapeutic effects have been inconsistent across some controlled studies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The initial hypothesis that schizophrenia is a manifestation of hyperdopaminergia has recently been faulted. However, several new findings suggest that abnormal, although not necessarily excessive, dopamine activity is an important factor in schizophrenia. The authors discuss these findings and their implications. METHOD: All published studies regarding dopamine and schizophrenia and all studies on the role of dopamine in cognition were reviewed. Attention has focused on post-mortem studies, positron emission tomography, neuroleptic drug actions, plasma levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), and cerebral blood flow. RESULTS: Evidence, particularly from intracellular recording studies in animals and plasma HVA measurements, suggests that neuroleptics act by reducing dopamine activity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Post-mortem studies have shown high dopamine and HVA concentrations in various subcortical brain regions and greater than normal dopamine receptor densities in the brains of schizophrenic patients. On the other hand, the negative/deficit symptom complex of schizophrenia may be associated with low dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex. Recent animal and human studies suggest that prefrontal dopamine neurons inhibit subcortical dopamine activity. The authors hypothesize that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormally low prefrontal dopamine activity (causing deficit symptoms) leading to excessive dopamine activity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons (causing positive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: The possible co-occurrence of high and low dopamine activity in schizophrenia has implications for the conceptualization of dopamine's role in schizophrenia. It would explain the concurrent presence of negative and positive symptoms. This hypothesis is testable and has important implications for treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.},

In this study we examined the effects on anxiety of temporary neuronal inhibition of various aspects of the septo-hippocampal system in rats. Infusions of tetrodotoxin (TTX) were used to induce reversible lesions in the fimbria fornix, medial septum, dorsal hippocampus, and ventral hippocampus. To assess anxiety we used the elevated plus-maze and the shock-probe burying tests. A reduction in anxiety in the elevated plus-maze is indicated by increased open arm exploration, whereas a reduction in anxiety in the shock-probe burying test is indicated by decreased burying behavior or increased contacts with the shock-probe. The results suggested that inhibition of the septal\textendash hippocampal system induced site-specific anxiolytic effects that vary in nature. Tetrodotoxin lesions of the fimbria fornix increased both open arm exploration and the number of shocks taken by the rats, while having no effect on burying behavior. Both septal and ventral hippocampal lesions increased open arm exploration and decreased burying behavior, but had no effect on the number of probe shocks. Finally, TTX lesions of the dorsal hippocampus increased the number of shocks taken by the rats, but did not affect open arm activity or burying behavior. Neuroanatomical studies indicated that the effect on the number of shocks induced by dorsal hippocampal TTX lesions was not likely mediated by the amygdala. Collectively, the data suggest that the control of specific anxiety reactions is functionally segregated within different aspects of the septo-hippocampal system.},

Although combined infusions of intraseptal muscimol and intrahippocampal physostigmine did not increase the magnitude of anxiolysis, this may have been due to ``ceiling'' effects.

Chemogenetic silencing of dmPFC and vmPFC projections to lateral and medial mediodorsal thalamus subregions oppositely regulate cognitive control.

Few findings are reported on DMN and the involvement of dopaminergic medication on this network in Parkinson's disease (PD). To evaluate the effect of levodopa on DMN deactivation, we conducted a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled experiment consisting of two fMRI assessments in fourteen non-demented, non-depressed PD patients compared to thirteen healthy volunteers. They received either acute doses of levodopa or placebo in two fMRI sessions. Brain deactivation was evaluated during a facial emotion recognition task. While the control subjects showed a classical brain deactivation pattern during the emotional task, the PD patients taking placebo only deactivated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Patients failed to deactivate the posterior midline and lateral parts of DMN network. After levodopa administration, this network was restored conjointly with the improvement of motor dysfunction in PD patients. The levodopa effect on DMN is probably the consequence of a beneficial dopamine (DA) medication effect which leads to a fine tuning of the dopamine level in the motor part of striatum, resulting to a global improvement of physical state of PD patients and consequently an increased attentional resource to external stimuli. The absence of medial prefrontal deactivation impairment may suggest a preserved mesocortical DA system in these patients.},

Critically, at P12, inactivation of~the medial septum eliminates theta in both structures. The developmental emergence of theta-dependent functional coupling between the hippocampus and RN parallels that between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

  abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a pivotal role in processing and conveying spatial information to the hippocampus. It has long been known that EC neurons are modulated by cholinergic input from the medial septum. However, little is known as to how synaptic release of acetylcholine affects the different cell types in EC. Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in EC. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and II (LI and LII). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in LI and LII of both medial and lateral EC. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT3R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic GABAergic inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease GABA alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral EC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EC activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of LI and LII neurons by the septal cholinergic system.},

It is indeed well established that sustaining an outwardly-directed electrochemical Cl- gradient across the neuronal membrane is fundamental for a proper function of postsynaptic GABAA receptor signaling. In particular, studies in the last two decades have shown that KCC2 activity is important to maintain a hyperpolarizing GABAergic neurotransmission. Conversely, low KCC2 activity should lead to depolarizing, and under specific conditions, excitatory GABAergic transmission. Not surprisingly given the critical role of KCC2 in regulating the inhibitory drive, alterations in its expression levels and activity are linked with epilepsy. Here, we will first summarize data regarding the role of KCC2 in epileptiform synchronization. Next, we will review evidence indicating that KCC2 expression and function are altered in chronic epileptic disorders, both in the developing and adult brain. We will also go through recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in KCC2 activity that occur following seizures. Finally, we will consider the modulation of KCC2 function as a potential, novel therapeutic target for the treatment of epileptic disorders.},

  abstract = {Memory consolidation in the neocortex Information transfer between brain structures located in the medial-temporal lobe and the neocortex is essential for learning. However, the neuronal underpinnings of this transfer are unknown. Doron et al. found that neurons located in the deep layers of the perirhinal cortex exhibit increased firing after microstimulation upon learning (see the Perspective by Donato). Learning was associated with the emergence of a small population of neurons in layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex that increased bursting upon stimulation. This increase in bursting was accompanied by an increase in dendritic activity, and silencing the perirhinal cortex to layer 1 projection effectively disrupted learning and its physiological correlates. During learning, perirhinal inputs thus act as a gate for the enhancement of cortico-cortical inputs, which are necessary for stimulus detection and are strengthened during learning. Science, this issue p. eaaz3136; see also p. 1410 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONArguably one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience is how the brain stores long-term memories. Since the 1950s, it has been well established that long-term memories reside in the neocortex but that their formation is dependent on the hippocampus and medial-temporal lobe structures. It is therefore remarkable that we still do not know what cellular mechanisms underlie long-term memory storage in the neocortex or exactly where they are located. RATIONALEThe primary challenge for investigating the neural circuit underlying memory formation in the neocortex is the distributed nature of the resulting memory trace throughout the cortex. We therefore used a behavioral paradigm dependent on both the hippocampus and neocortex that enabled us to generate memory traces in a specific cortical location by training rodents to associate the direct electrical microstimulation of the cortex with a reward. This also allowed us to specifically examine the contribution of circuit elements in the defined anatomical location. Rodents learned to behaviorally report the microstimulation within only a few trials and improved over a 3-day period, during which we examined the evolution of learned neuronal responses in the stimulated area. We hypothesized that the influence of the hippocampus on memory formation in the neocortex occurs at the interface between these two structures. RESULTSWe first confirmed that learning to associate microstimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with a reward depends on hippocampal activity using suppression of action potentials (APs) with lidocaine in this brain area. Using retrograde and anterograde tracing methods, we found that the perirhinal cortex (the last station in the medial-temporal loop projecting to S1) predominantly targets layer 1 (L1), suggesting that important events relating to memory formation occur in neocortical L1. We tested this with targeted chemogenetic suppression of perirhinal input to L1 above the stimulated S1 region. Notably, this very specific and localized manipulation was sufficient to disrupt learning. The effect was learning-specific and had no influence in expert animals, which demonstrated that the perirhinal input did not alter the ability to perceive and behaviorally report the stimulus, per se. We found that the perirhinal cortex signaled information related to successful behavior during learning, gated the evolution of distinct firing, and enhanced burst responses in 11\% of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in S1 (40\% of neurons had reduced firing responses and 49\% showed no change in firing). Apical dendritic excitability was correspondingly enhanced in a similar proportion of L5 pyramidal neurons. This suggested that the mechanism for memory formation had a dendritic origin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that both activation of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors\textemdash which disrupt apical dendritic calcium (Ca2+) activity\textemdash and activation of dendritic-targeting, somatostatin-positive interneurons impaired memory formation similarly to suppressing perirhinal input to L1. Finally, we found that after learning the microstimulation detection task, evoking a single burst of APs (but not the same number of low-frequency spikes) in a single L5 pyramidal neuron could trigger behavior. CONCLUSIONWe found that medial-temporal input to neocortical L1 gates the evolution of specific firing responses in subpopulations of L5 pyramidal neurons including up- and down-regulated firing patterns and an elevation in burstiness by means of a mechanism that is most likely related to apical dendritic activity. After learning, these neocortical responses become independent of the medial-temporal influence but continue to evoke behavior with bursts conveying higher saliency. We conclude that L1 is the locus for hippocampal-dependent associative learning in the neocortex, where memory engrams are established in subsets of pyramidal neurons by enhancing the sensitivity of tuft dendrites to contextual inputs and driving burst firing. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6523/eaaz3136/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Probing the influence of the medial-temporal lobe on memory formation.(A) The perirhinal cortex (PRh), part of the medial-temporal lobe (MTL) structures (blue box), targets L1 in S1. (B) We performed microstimulation ({$\mu$}Stim) of L5 in the sensory cortex while chemogenetically suppressing the axonal projection to cortical L1 (red) from PRh (blue arrow). (C) Rodents learned to associate {$\mu$}Stim with water reward. (D to F) Learning was suppressed by blocking MTL input [(D) and (E)] that otherwise evoked dendritic activity in L5 pyramidal neurons [(F), orange tuft], which allowed them to associate contextual input to L1 with the {$\mu$}Stim. (G) More than 3 days of learning led to subpopulations of firing responses in L5 cells in S1 such that evoking a burst but not low-frequency spikes in single L5 cells retrieved learned behavior. Hippocampal output influences memory formation in the neocortex, but this process is poorly understood because the precise anatomical location and the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that perirhinal input, predominantly to sensory cortical layer 1 (L1), controls hippocampal-dependent associative learning in rodents. This process was marked by the emergence of distinct firing responses in defined subpopulations of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons whose tuft dendrites receive perirhinal inputs in L1. Learning correlated with burst firing and the enhancement of dendritic excitability, and it was suppressed by disruption of dendritic activity. Furthermore, bursts, but not regular spike trains, were sufficient to retrieve learned behavior. We conclude that hippocampal information arriving at L5 tuft dendrites in neocortical L1 mediates memory formation in the neocortex. Perirhinal input, predominantly to sensory cortical layer 1, controls hippocampal-dependent associative learning in mice. Perirhinal input, predominantly to sensory cortical layer 1, controls hippocampal-dependent associative learning in mice.},

  abstract = {The medial septal region and the hippocampus are connected reciprocally via GABAergic neurons, but the physiological role of this loop is still not well understood. In an attempt to reveal the physiological effects of the hippocamposeptal GABAergic projection, we cross-correlated hippocampal sharp wave (SPW) ripples or theta activity and extracellular units recorded in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) in freely moving rats. The majority of single MSDB cells (60\%) were significantly suppressed during SPWs. Most cells inhibited during SPW (80\%) fired rhythmically and phase-locked to the negative peak of the CA1 pyramidal layer theta waves. Because both SPW and the negative peak of local theta waves correspond to the maximum discharge probability of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneuron classes, the findings indicate that the activity of medial septal neurons can be negatively (during SPW) or positively (during theta waves) correlated with the activity of hippocampal interneurons. We hypothesize that the functional coupling between medial septal neurons and hippocampal interneurons varies in a state-dependent manner.},

Non-noxious natural stimulations were relatively ineffective. In contrast, 68\% of the SHNs were driven by noxious stimulation. The SHNs could be driven either by mechanical or thermal stimulation. Intraperitoneal injection of bradykinin excited about half of the SHNs. Some neurons were able to encode stimulus intensity (strength of the mechanical stimulation and/or temperature of the thermal stimulation).

Our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms that render the brain epileptogenic remain incomplete, reflected by the lack of satisfactory treatments that can effectively prevent epileptic seizures without significant drug-related adverse effects. Type 2 K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC2), encoded by SLC12A5, is important for chloride homeostasis and neuronal excitability. KCC2 dysfunction attenuates Cl- extrusion and impairs GABAergic inhibition, and can lead to neuronal hyperexcitability. Converging lines of evidence from human genetics have secured the link between KCC2 dysfunction and the development of epilepsy. Here, we review KCC2 mutations in human epilepsy and discuss potential therapeutic strategies based on the functional impact of these mutations. We suggest a strategy of augmenting KCC2 activity by antagonizing its critical inhibitory phosphorylation sites may be a particularly efficacious method of facilitating Cl- extrusion and restoring GABA inhibition to treat medication-refractory epilepsy and other seizure disorders.},

  abstract = {Loss of cholinergic cortical input is associated with diseases in which episodic memory impairment is a prominent feature, but the degree to which this neurochemical lesion can account for memory impairment in humans with neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Removal of cholinergic input to hippocampus impairs some of its functions in memory, perhaps by reducing the plasticity of information representation within the hippocampus, but the role of cholinergic hippocampal input in episodic-like memories has not been investigated. To address this question, we tested rats with selective lesions of basal forebrain neurons in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/VDB), which contains hippocampal-projecting cholinergic neurons, on a task of integrated memory for objects, places, and contexts (``what\textendash where\textendash which'' memory). This task serves as a rodent model of human episodic memory (episodic-like memory) and is sensitive to damage to the hippocampal system. Rats with lesions of cholinergic MS/VDB neurons performed as well on the what\textendash where\textendash which task as controls, but were impaired in a task that simply required them to associate places with contexts (``where\textendash which'' memory). Thus, episodic-like memories that rely on the hippocampus do not require cholinergic neuromodulation to be formed. Nevertheless, some more specific aspects of where\textendash which memory, which may be more dependent on the plasticity of hippocampal spatial representations, require acetylcholine. These results suggest that cholinergic projections to hippocampus are not necessary for episodic memory and, furthermore, that hippocampal spatial representations may be to some extent dissociable from episodic memory function. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here, we show that millisecond-timescale coactivity among hippocampal CA1 neurons discriminates distinct, short-lived behavioral contingencies. This contingency discrimination was unrelated to the tuning of individual neurons, but was instead an emergent property of their coactivity. Contingency-discriminating patterns were reactivated offline after learning, and their reinstatement predicted trial-by-trial memory performance.

These findings identify millisecond-timescale coactivity as a primary feature of neural firing that encodes behaviorally relevant variables and supports memory retrieval.},

The impairment in spatial learning appears not to be caused by sensorimotor or motivational disturbances, or anxiogenic-like behavior. Thus, d-AP5-treated rats were not impaired in swim performance or visuospatial abilities and spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. In the PA task, intraseptal d-AP5 infused 15 min before training impaired retention as examined 24 h after training.

  abstract = {Neural dynamics preceding seizures are of interest because they may shed light on mechanisms of seizure generation and could be predictive. In healthy animals, hippocampal network activity is shaped by behavioral brain state and, in epilepsy, seizures selectively emerge during specific brain states. To determine the degree to which changes in network dynamics before seizure are pathological or reflect ongoing fluctuations in brain state, dorsal hippocampal neurons were recorded during spontaneous seizures in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures emerged from all brain states, but with a greater likelihood after REM sleep, potentially due to an observed increase in baseline excitability during periods of REM compared with other brains states also characterized by sustained theta oscillations. When comparing the firing patterns of the same neurons across brain states associated with and without seizures, activity dynamics before seizures followed patterns typical of the ongoing brain state, or brain state transitions, and did not differ until the onset of the electrographic seizure. Next, we tested whether disparate activity patterns during distinct brain states would influence the effectiveness of optogenetic curtailment of hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Optogenetic curtailment was significantly more effective for seizures preceded by non-theta states compared with seizures that emerged from theta states. Our results indicate that consideration of behavioral brain state preceding a seizure is important for the appropriate interpretation of network dynamics leading up to a seizure and for designing effective seizure intervention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Hippocampal single-unit activity is strongly shaped by behavioral brain state, yet this relationship has been largely ignored when studying activity dynamics before spontaneous seizures in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. In light of the increased attention on using single-unit activity for the prediction of seizure onset and closed-loop seizure intervention, we show a need for monitoring brain state to interpret correctly whether changes in neural activity before seizure onset is pathological or normal. Moreover, we also find that the brain state preceding a seizure determines the success of therapeutic interventions to curtail seizure duration. Together, these findings suggest that seizure prediction and intervention will be more successful if tailored for the specific brain states from which seizures emerge.},

In this manuscript, we review evidence for gamma modulation deficits during cognitive performance in schizophrenia. We demonstrate that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) is a reliable method that permits systematic quantification of gamma modulation in the cortex. Using TMS\textendash EEG, we show that patients with schizophrenia have selective gamma inhibition deficits in the DLPFC. Finally, we demonstrate that repetitive TMS therapy over the DLPFC can normalize excessive gamma oscillations and ultimately cognitive performance in patients.

We investigated the apparent noise (``overdispersion'') in the CA1 place code, hypothesizing that overdispersion results from discharge fluctuations as spatial attention alternates between distal cues and local/self-motion cues. The hypothesis predicts that: (1) preferential use of distal cues will decrease overdispersion; (2) global, attention-like states can be decoded from ensemble discharge such that both the discharge rates and the spatial firing patterns of individual cells will be distinct in the two states; (3) identifying attention-like states improves reconstructions of the rat's path from ensemble discharge. These predictions were confirmed, implying that a covert, dynamic attention-like process modulates discharge on a {$\sim$}1 s time scale. We conclude the hippocampus place code is a dynamic representation of the spatial information in the immediate focus of attention.},

The discharge of place cells is confined with remarkable precision to a cell-specific part of the environment called the cell's ``firing field.'' We demonstrate here that firing is not nearly as reliable in the time domain as in the positional domain. Discharge during passes through the firing field was compared with a model with Poisson variance of the location-specific firing determined by the time-averaged positional firing rate distribution. Place cells characteristically fire too little or too much compared with expectations from the random model. This fundamental property of place cells is referred to as ``excess firing variance'' and has three main implications: (i) Place cell discharge is not only driven by the summation of many small, asynchronous excitatory synaptic inputs. (ii) Place cell discharge may encode a signal in addition to the current head location. (iii) The excess firing variance helps explain why the errors in computing the rat's position from the simultaneous activity of many place cells are large.},

  abstract = {Several decades of research have established that different kinds of memories result from the activity of discrete neural networks. Studying how these networks process information in experiments that target specific types of mnemonic representations has provided deep insights into memory architecture and its neural underpinnings. However, in natural settings reality confronts organisms with problems that are not neatly compartmentalized. Thus, a critical problem in memory research that still needs to be addressed is how distinct types of memories are ultimately integrated. Here we demonstrate how two memory networks, the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum, may accomplish such a goal. The hippocampus supports memory for facts and events, collectively known as declarative memory and often studied as spatial memory in rodents. The dorsolateral striatum provides the basis for habits that are assessed in stimulus\textendash response types of tasks. Expanding previous findings, the current work revealed that in male Long\textendash Evans rats, the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum use time and space in distinct and largely complementary ways to integrate spatial and habitual representations. Specifically, the hippocampus supported both types of memories when they were formed in temporal juxtaposition, even if the learning took place in different environments. In contrast, the lateral striatum supported both types of memories if they were formed in the same environment, even at temporally distinct points. These results reveal for the first time that by using fundamental aspects of experience in specific ways, the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum can transcend their attributed roles in information storage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current paradigm in memory research postulates that different types of memories reflected in separate types of behavioral strategies result from activity in distinct neural circuits. However, recent data have shown that when rats concurrently acquired in the same environment of hippocampal-dependent spatial navigation and striatal-dependent approach of a visual cue, each of the two types of memories became dependent on both the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum. The current work reveals that the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum use distinct and complementary principles to integrate different types of memories in time and space: the hippocampus integrates memories formed in temporal proximity, while the lateral striatum integrates memories formed in the same space.},

The theta-phase preference and excitatory strength of the afferent CA3 and entorhinal inputs effectively timed the principal neuron activity, as well as regulated distinct CA1 interneuron populations in multiple tasks and behavioral states. Feedback potentiation of distal dendritic inhibition by CA1 place cells attenuated the excitatory entorhinal input at place field entry, coupled with feedback depression of proximal dendritic and perisomatic inhibition, allowing the CA3 input to gain control toward the exit. Thus, upstream inputs interact with local mechanisms to determine theta-phase timing of hippocampal neurons to support memory and spatial navigation.},

  abstract = {Brain region coordination in learning Gamma-frequency oscillations have been hypothesized as a physiological mechanism of interregional communication in the brain. However, until now, all supporting data have been correlational and thus indirect. Fern\'andez-Ruiz et al. examined gamma-frequency activity and spike coupling between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus during learning and after selective perturbation of gamma-frequency spike timing. They observed an integrated neuron, gamma-band, and task-specific organization of the entorhinal cortex\textendash hippocampal circuits. These data demonstrate that specific, projected gamma-frequency oscillation patterns dynamically engage functionally related cell assemblies across brain regions in a task-specific manner. Science, this issue p. eabf3119 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONLearning induces a dynamic reorganization of brain circuits but the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Interregional gamma-frequency oscillations (\textasciitilde 30 to 150 Hz) have been postulated as a mechanism to precisely coordinate upstream and downstream neuronal ensembles, for example, in the hippocampal system. The lateral (LEC) and medial (MEC) entorhinal cortex receive inputs from two distinct streams of cortical hierarchy (the ``what'' and the ``where'' pathways) and convey these neuronal messages to the hippocampus. However, the mechanisms by which such messages are packaged and integrated or segregated by hippocampal circuits had yet to be explored. RATIONALENeuronal assemblies firing within gamma time frames in an upstream region can most effectively discharge their downstream partners. This gamma-time-scale organization appears essential for physiological functions because manipulations that impair precision timing of spikes in the hippocampus often affect behavior. However, direct support for distinct gamma-frequency communication in appropriate behavioral situations is missing. To bring physiological operations closer to behavior, we designed ``spatial'' and ``object'' learning tasks and examined the selective engagement of gamma-frequency communication between the MEC and LEC inputs and their target neuronal assemblies in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We combined these correlational observations with optogenetic perturbation of gamma oscillations in LEC and MEC, respectively, to test their roles in pathway-specific neuronal communication and learning. RESULTSDuring spatial learning, fast gamma (100 to 150 Hz) oscillations synchronized MEC and dentate gyrus and entrained predominantly granule cells. During object learning, slow gamma (30 to 50 Hz) oscillations synchronized LEC and dentate gyrus and preferentially recruited mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, suggesting task-specific routing of MEC and LEC messages in the form of gamma-cycle-spike packets of selected cell types. The low- and high-frequency gamma sub-bands were dominant in the outer and middle third of the dentate molecular layer, respectively, and their amplitude maxima were locked to different phases of theta oscillations.Gamma frequency optogenenetic perturbation of MEC and LEC led to learning impairments in a spatial and object learning task, respectively. In the same animals, the dentate layer\textendash specific low- and high-frequency gamma sub-bands and spike-gamma LFP coupling were selectively reduced, coupled with deterioration of spatial and object-related firing of dentate neurons. CONCLUSIONThese findings demonstrate that distinct gamma-frequency-specific communication between MEC and LEC and hippocampal cell assemblies are critical for routing task-relevant information, and our selective gamma-band perturbation experiments suggest that they support specific aspects of learning. We hypothesize that sending neuronal messages by segregated gamma-frequency carriers allows a target ``reader'' area to disambiguate convergent inputs. In general, these results demonstrate that specific projected gamma patterns dynamically engage functionally related cell assemblies across brain regions in a task-specific manner. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6537/eabf3119/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Task-specific engagement and gamma-frequency coupling of distinct neuronal populations.First row: Impairment of spatial (left) and object (right) learning during gamma-frequency perturbation of MEC (left) and LEC (right). Second row: MEC and LEC project high-frequency (gammaF) and low-frequency (gammaS) gamma oscillations to DG, respectively, and entrain granule cells, mossy cells, and CA3 pyramidal neurons in a task-specific manner. Gamma oscillations are thought to coordinate the spike timing of functionally specialized neuronal ensembles across brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically perturbed gamma spike timing in the rat medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) entorhinal cortices and found impairments in spatial and object learning tasks, respectively. MEC and LEC were synchronized with the hippocampal dentate gyrus through high- and low-gamma-frequency rhythms, respectively, and engaged either granule cells or mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells in a task-dependent manner. Gamma perturbation disrupted the learning-induced assembly organization of target neurons. Our findings imply that pathway-specific gamma oscillations route task-relevant information between distinct neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. We hypothesize that interregional gamma-time-scale spike coordination is a mechanism of neuronal communication.

  abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is widely known for its utility as a biomedical imaging modality. An abundance of evidence has recently accumulated showing that US is also useful for non-invasively modulating brain circuit activity. Through a series of studies discussed in this short review, it has recently become recognized that transcranial focused ultrasound can exert mechanical (non-thermal) bioeffects on neurons and cells to produce focal changes in the activity of brain circuits. In addition to highlighting scientific breakthroughs and observations that have driven the development of the field of ultrasonic neuromodulation, this study also provides a discussion of mechanisms of action underlying the ability of ultrasound to physically stimulate and modulate brain circuit activity. Exemplifying some forward-looking tools that can be developed by integrating ultrasonic neuromodulation with other advanced acoustic technologies, some innovative acoustic imaging, beam forming, and focusing techniques are briefly reviewed. Finally, the future outlook for ultrasonic neuromodulation is discussed, specifically in the context of applications employing transcranial focused ultrasound for the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures {$>$}24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring {$>$}24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60\%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. ``Resolved'' is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of ``remission or ``cure.'' Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use.

In a multicenter study, stimulation of anterior thalamus was shown to reduce numbers of seizures, but decrease was only in the range of 40\%. This might be improved with septal stimulation, which has strong and direct reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation, the structure most involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Medial septal neurons drive a 3\textendash 12Hz theta rhythm in hippocampus of rodents. Theta rhythm is less obvious in human hippocampus, but it is present and it varies with cognitive tasks. The hippocampal theta rhythm is disrupted by seizures. In animal models, restoration of theta by sensory stimulation, septal electrical stimulation or cholinergic drugs infused into septum ameliorates seizures. Seizure activity in hippocampus is faithfully reflected in septal nuclei, and septum sometimes leads the seizure activity. A subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have structural enlargement of their septal nuclei. At high levels of intensity, septal stimulation is subjectively pleasurable and strongly reinforcing. Rats will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate their septum. Initial experience with human septal stimulation in the 1950s was not favorable, with ineffective therapy for schizophrenia and a high rate of surgical complications. Subsequent experience in 50\textendash 100 pain patients employing modern neurosurgical techniques was more favorable and demonstrated septal stimulation to be safe and tolerable. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to consider design of a clinical trial of medial septal stimulation in selected patients with medication-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.},

Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or ``rhythms''). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.},

This includes afferent information from muscles, joints, and skin, as well as visual feedback to plan, initiate, and execute motor output. In tetraplegia, this neural communication is interrupted in both directions at the level of the spinal cord. Brain\textendash computer interfaces have been developed to produce voluntary motor output controlled by directly recording from brain activity. Flesher et al. added an afferent channel to the brain\textendash computer interface to mimic sensory input from the skin of a hand (see the Perspective by Faisal). The improvements achieved by adding the afferent input were substantial in a battery of motor tasks tested in a human subject. Science, abd0380, this issue p. 831; see also abi7262, p. 791 Prosthetic arms controlled by a brain-computer interface can enable people with tetraplegia to perform functional movements. However, vision provides limited feedback because information about grasping objects is best relayed through tactile feedback. We supplemented vision with tactile percepts evoked using a bidirectional brain-computer interface that records neural activity from the motor cortex and generates tactile sensations through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex. This enabled a person with tetraplegia to substantially improve performance with a robotic limb; trial times on a clinical upper-limb assessment were reduced by half, from a median time of 20.9 to 10.2 seconds. Faster times were primarily due to less time spent attempting to grasp objects, revealing that mimicking known biological control principles results in task performance that is closer to able-bodied human abilities. Creating artificial tactile feedback greatly improves the ability of a person with tetraplegia to manipulate objects with a robotic limb.

TUS neuromodulatory effects were measured by examining relationships between activity in each area and the rest of the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In control conditions without sonication, activity in a given area is related to activity in interconnected regions, but such relationships are reduced after sonication, specifically for the targeted areas. Dissociable and focal effects on neural activity could not be explained by auditory confounds.},

The brain slices were processed sequentially with purified antisera against NAAG and then monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a marker for cholinergic neurons, or antiserum against dopamine-{$\beta$}-hydroxylase (DBH), a marker of noradrenergic-adrenergic neurons, or antiserum against serotonin (5HT). Both antigens were revealed by the peroxidase reaction but with different chromogens, which are easily distinguishable. An intense double staining of NAAG-like immunoreactivity (NAAG-LI) and ChAT was observed in the motoneurons of the spinal cord as well as in the several motor components of cranial nerve nuclei including facial, ambiguus, and trigeminal nuclei. A partial colocalization of NAAG-LI and ChAT was evident in the perikarya of the basal forebrain cholinergic system, whereas cholinergic neurons of the medial septum exhibited only sporadic staining for NAAG-LI. A complete coexistence of NAAG-LI and DBH was observed in the locus coeruleus. Most of the other noradrenergic and adrenergic cell groups of the medulla region exhibited substantial co-localization with the exception of the A2 cell group, which was virtually devoid of NAAG-LI. In the dorsal raphe, only a low percentage of serotonergic neurons stained for NAAG-LI. The co-existence of NAAG-LI and serotonin was more evident in the neurons of the median raphe, although the majority of cells failed to show double staining. In the raphe pallidus and raphe magnus, the co-existence with NAAG-LI remained partial but involved a large percentage of serotonergic neurons. These results suggest a more widespread neuronal function of NAAG in addition to its proposed role as putative neurotransmitter in a subgroup of glutamatergic neurons.},

The most studied neurostimulation method for anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD was repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This neurostimulation technique had the highest level of evidence for GAD. There were also randomized sham-controlled trials indicating that rTMS may be effective in the treatment of PTSD and OCD, but there were conflicting findings regarding these two disorders. There is indication that rTMS may be effective in the treatment of panic disorder, but the level of evidence is low. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was most studied for treatment of OCD, but the randomized sham-controlled trials had mixed findings. Preliminary findings indicate that DBS could be affective for PTSD. There is weak evidence indicating that electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and trigeminal nerve stimulation could be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD.

Information flow in this circuit is strongly influenced by relatively sparse afferents derived from subcortical centres, such as the septum, involved in arousal, emotions and autonomic control. A powerful mechanism, by which numerically small inputs can produce profound effects, is feed-forward inhibition1, that is, the activation of local inhibitory interneurons, which, in turn, control the activity of large populations of principal cells in the hippocampus. An example is the cholinergic input to the hippocampus from the septum, which is likely to be involved in feed-forward operations2\textendash 8. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a circuit underlying another powerful mechanism of subcortical control of hippocampal information processing. We show that GABA-containing afferents originating in the septum innervate most of the GABA-containing interneurons in the hippocampus, making many synaptic contacts with each of them. Activation of the GABA-containing neurons in the septum is likely to lead to disinhi-bition of the principal neurons in the hippocampal formation and so this pathway is probably crucial in the induction of hippocampal electrical activity patterns, and may be involved in NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-mediated functions, such as memory9, in a permissive manner.},

  abstract = {Modulation of receptive field properties of thalamic somatosensory neurons by the depth of anesthesia.  The dominant frequency of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings was used to determine the depth of halothane or urethan anesthesia while recording extracellular single-unit responses from thalamic ventral posterior medial (VPM) neurons. A piezoelectric stimulator was used to deflect individual whiskers to assess the peak onset latency, magnitude, probability of response, and receptive field (RF) size. There was a predictable increase in the dominant ECoG frequency from deep stage IV to light stage III-1 anesthetic levels. There was no detectable frequency at stage IV, a 1- to 2-Hz dominant frequency at stage III-4, 3\textendash 4 Hz at stage III-3, 5\textendash 7 Hz at stage III-2, and a dual 6- and 10- to 13-Hz pattern at stage III-1. Reflexes and other physical signs showed a correlation with depth of anesthesia but exhibited too much overlap between stages to be used as a criterion for any single stage. RF size and peak onset latency of VPM neurons to whisker stimulations increased between stage III-4 and III-1. A dramatic increase in RF size and response latency occurred at the transition from stage III-3 (RF size {$\sim$}2 whiskers, latency {$\sim$}7 ms) to stage III-2 (RF size {$\sim$}6 whiskers, latency {$\sim$}11 ms). Response probability and magnitude decreased from stage III-4 to stage III-3 and III-2. No responses were ever evoked in VPM cells by vibrissa movement at stage IV. These changes in VPM responses as a function of anesthetic depth were seen only when the nucleus principalis (PrV) and nucleus interpolaris (SpVi) trigeminothalamic pathways were both intact. Eliminating SpVi inputs to VPM, either by cutting the primary trigeminal afferent fibers to SpVi or cutting axons projecting from SpVi to VPM, immediately reduced the RF size to fewer than three whiskers. In addition, the predictable changes in VPM response probability, response magnitude, and peak onset latency at different anesthetic depths were all absent after SpVi pathway interruption. We conclude that 1) the PrV input mediates the near ``one-to-one'' correspondence between a neuronal response in VPM and a single mystacial whisker, 2) in contrast, the SpVi input to VPM is primarily responsible for the RF properties of VPM neurons at light levels of anesthesia and presumably in the awake animal, and 3) alterations in VPM responses produced by changing the depth of anesthesia are due to its selective influence on the properties mediated by SpVi inputs at the level of the thalamus.},

At the light microscopic level, thin varicose ChAT-immunoreactive fibers were observed mainly in the vicinity of the pyramidal and granular layers where they formed a fine network around proximal dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells. In addition, many ChAT-immunoreactive fibers were found in the hilar region and in stratum oriens, radiatum, and lacunosum-moleculare of all hippocampal sectors. Electron microscopic analysis revealed ChAT immunoreactivity in thin unmyelinated varicose axons and terminals which established synaptic contacts. Asymmetric contacts of ChAT-immunoreactive terminals were found on small spines in the dendritic layers of the hippocampus proper and in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata. Symmetric synaptic contacts were formed on the cell bodies of pyramidal and granule cells. Both symmetric and asymmetric synaptic contacts occurred on dendritic shafts. The analysis of serial thin sections, which allows identification of postsynaptic elements, suggests that pyramidal cells, granule cells, and nonpyramidal neurons of the hippocampus receive a cholinergic input.},

Choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry was applied to 40-{$\mu$}m Vibratome sections cut perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Light microscopy revealed fine varicose ChAT-immunoreactive axons in all layers of the fascia dentata, i.e., in the stratum moleculare, the stratum granu-losum, and the subgranular polymorph zone. Most fibers were observed in the vicinity of granule cell bodies where they ran mainly parallel to the granular layer. Next, the immunostained Vibratome sections were sandwiched between small pieces of Parafilm and piled to form a block that was covered with agar and Golgi stained. After that, the sections were separated by cutting away the agar and removing the Parafilm. Sections containing well-impregnated granule cells were gold-toned (Fair\'en et al., '77), embedded in Araldite, and subjected to ultrathin sectioning for electron microscopy. A total of 14 gold-toned granule cells were examined in the electron microscope for synaptic contacts with cholinergic afferents. Choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive axon terminals were observed that established symmetric synaptic contacts with the cell bodies and dendritic shafts of the gold-toned identified granule cells. Two types of contact were observed on spines arising from gold-toned granule cell dendrites. Immunoreactive terminals established asymmetric synaptic contacts with the head of small spines and symmetric contacts with the stalk of large, complex spines. The boutons forming asymmetric synaptic contacts with the cup-shaped spine head of the complex spines were not found to be immunoreactive. Our results demonstrate that cholinergic fibers to the rat fascia dentata establish characteristic types of synaptic contact with different postsynaptic elements of granule cells, suggesting a complex function of this afferent system.},

This brain-state transition is associated with increased firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons and the occurrence of theta oscillations, which both correlate with locomotion velocity. However, the neural circuit by which locomotor activity is linked to hippocampal oscillations and neuronal firing rates is unresolved. Here we reveal a septo-hippocampal circuit mediated by glutamatergic (VGluT2+) neurons that is activated before locomotion onset and that controls the initiation and velocity of locomotion as well as the~entrainment of theta oscillations. Moreover, via septo-hippocampal projections onto alveus/oriens interneurons, this circuit regulates feedforward inhibition of Schaffer collateral and perforant path input to CA1 pyramidal neurons in a locomotion-dependent manner. With higher locomotion speed, the increased activity of medial septal VGluT2 neurons is translated into increased axo-somatic depolarization and higher firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Unanesthetized rats with external jugular cannulae were bled continuously at a rate of 50 \textmu l whole blood/7 min for 2 h prior to infusion and for 2\textendash 3 h during continuous intraventricular infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid or NE. Infusion of cerebrospinal fluid had no effect on pulsatile LH release, while continuous infusion of 0.3 or 1.8 \textmu g NE/h for 2\textendash 3 h produced suppression of pulsatile LH secretion. Although desensitization to the stimulatory effects of NE on LH release in ovariectomized, steroid-primed rats had been observed to occur rapidly within 90 min after the onset of infusion, desensitization to the inhibitory effect of NE on pulsatile LH release did not occur even after continuous infusion of NE for periods up to 20 h. Mean blood LH levels were as low in rats bled 17\textendash 20 h after the onset of NE infusion as in those bled at 0\textendash 3 h. The suppressive effect of NE on pulsatile LH release was not prevented by prior blockade of dopamine or serotonin receptors with pimozide or metergoline, respectively. Lastly, in all groups infused with NE, the decrease in mean blood LH levels was due solely to a suppression in LH pulse frequency, as no decrease occurred in pulse amplitude. These experiments demonstrate that (1) the inhibitory effect of NE is exerted solely on LH pulse frequency and suggest that NE suppresses only the firing rate of the presumed luteinizing hormone releasing hormone pulse generator in regulating pulsatile LH secretion; (2) whereas desensitization is rapidly established in the neuronal receptors excitatory to LH release, this phenomenon is not observed when pulsatile LH release is suppressed by NE for much longer periods of time, and (3) dopamine and serotonin are not involved as possible interneuronal transmitter mediators of the inhibitory effects of NE upon pulsatile LH and presumably pulsatile luteinizing hormone releasing hormone secretion.},

The low voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 isoforms) play a critical role in regulating these processes. Despite their wide expression throughout the central nervous system, the implication of T-type Cav3.2 isoform in brain functions is still poorly characterized. Here we investigate the effect of genetic ablation of this isoform in affective disorders, including anxiety, cognitive functions as well as sensitivity to drugs of abuse. Using a wide range of behavioral assays we show that genetic ablation of the cacna1h gene results in an anxiety-like phenotype, whereas novelty-induced locomotor activity is unaffected. Deletion of the T-type channel Cav3.2 also triggers impairment of hippocampus-dependent recognition memories. Acute and sensitized hyperlocomotion induced by d-amphetamine and cocaine are dramatically reduced in T-type Cav3.2 deficient mice. In addition, the administration of the T-type blocker TTA-A2 prevented the expression of locomotor sensitization observed in wildtype mice. In conclusion, our data reveal that physiological activity of this specific Ca2+ channel is required for affective and cognitive behaviors. Moreover, our work highlights the interest of T-type channel blockers as therapeutic strategies to reverse drug-associated alterations.},

We have determined that medial septal neurons increase their firing rates during chronic epilepsy and that the GABAergic neurons from both medial and lateral septal regions are highly and selectively vulnerable to the epilepsy process. Since the lateral septal region receives a strong projection from the hippocampus and its neurons are vulnerable to epilepsy, their functional properties are probably altered by this disorder. Using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy we examined the pilocarpine-induced functional alterations of lateral septal neurons and provided additional observations on the pilocarpine-induced functional alterations of medial septal neurons. Simultaneous extracellular recordings of septal neurons and hippocampal field potentials were obtained from chronic epileptic rats under urethane anesthesia. Our results show that: (1) the firing rates of lateral septal neurons were chronically decreased by epilepsy, (2) a subset of lateral septal neurons increased their firing rates before and during hippocampal interictal spikes, (3) the discharges of those lateral septal neurons were well correlated to the hippocampal interictal spikes, (4) in contrast, the discharges of medial septal neurons were not correlated with the hippocampal interictal spikes. We conclude that epilepsy creates dysfunctional and uncoupled septo-hippocampal networks. The elucidation of the roles of altered septo-hippocampal neuronal populations and networks during temporal lobe epilepsy will help design new and effective interventions dedicated to reduce or suppress epileptic activity.},

Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations3, and are organized in modules4,5 which collectively form a population code for the animal's allocentric position1,6\textendash 8. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments9,10 and behavioural states11,12, independently of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,2,13\textendash 16. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained elusive due to the small samples of cells obtained to date. Here we show, with simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells, and subsequent topological data analysis, that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to the moving animal's position in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained, with minimal distortion, between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feed-forward models where grid patterns are created from external inputs by Hebbian plasticity17\textendash 22. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides the first population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {The septal region of the basal forebrain plays a critical role modulating hippocampal excitability and functional states. Septal circuits may also play a role in controlling abnormal hippocampal hyperexcitability in epilepsy. Both lateral and medial septal neurons are targets of hippocampal axons. Since the hippocampus is an important epileptogenic area in temporal lobe epilepsy, we hypothesize that excessive excitatory output will promote sustained neurodegeneration of septal region neurons. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) was chosen as a model to generate chronic epileptic animals. To determine whether septal neuronal populations are affected by hippocampal seizures, immunohistochemical assays were performed in brain sections obtained from age-matched control, latent period (7 days post-SE) and chronically epileptic (more than one month post-SE survival) rats. An anti-NeuN (neuronal nuclei) antibody was used to study total neuronal numbers. Anti-ChAT (choline acetyltransferase), anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) isoenzymes (65 and 67), and anti-glutamate antibodies were used to reveal cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. Our results revealed a significant atrophy of medial and lateral septal areas in all chronically epileptic rats. Overall neuronal density in the septum (medial and lateral septum), assessed by NeuN immunoreactivity, was significantly reduced by approximately 40\% in chronically epileptic rats. The lessening of neuronal numbers in both regions was mainly due to the loss of GABAergic neurons (80\textendash 97\% reduction in medial and lateral septum). In contrast, populations of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons were spared. Overall, these data indicate that septal GABAergic neurons are selectively vulnerable to hippocampal hyperexcitability, and suggest that the processing of information in septohippocampal networks may be altered in chronic epilepsy.},

The tracer was injected iontophoretically into cell groups of the medial septum (MS) and the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB and HDB), and sections were processed immunohistochemically for the intra-axonally transported PHA-L. The labeled efferents showed remarkable differences in regional distribution in the cortical mantle dependent on the position of the injection site in the MS/DB complex, revealing a topographic organization of the MS/DB-cortical projection. In brief, the lateral and intermediate aspects of the HDB, also referred to as the magnocellular preoptic area, predominantly project to the olfactory nuclei and the lateral entorhinal cortex. The medial part of the HDB and adjacent caudal (angular) part of the VDB are characterized by widespread, abundant projections to medial mesolimbic, occipital, and lateral entorhinal cortices, olfactory bulb, and dorsal aspects of the subicular and hippocampal areas. Projections from the rostromedial part of the VDB and from the MS are preponderantly aimed at the entire hippocampal and retrohippocampal regions and to a lesser degree at the medial mesolimbic cortex. Furthermore, the MS projections are subject to a clear mediolateral topographic arrangement, such that the lateral MS predominantly projects to the ventral/temporal aspects of the subicular complex and hippocampus and to the medial portion of the entorhinal cortex, whereas more medially located cells in the MS innervate more septal/dorsal parts of the hippocampal and subicular areas and more lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex. PHA-L filled axons have been observed to course through a number of pathways, i. e., the fimbria-fornix system, supracallosal stria, olfactory peduncle, and lateral piriform route (the latter two mainly by the HDB and caudal VDB). Generally, labeled projections were distributed throughout all cortical layers, although clear patterns of lamination were present in several target areas. The richly branching fibers were abundantly provided with both ``boutons en passant'' and terminal boutons. Both distribution and morphology of the labeled basal forebrain efferents in the prefrontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices closely resemble the distribution and morphology of the cholinergic innervation as revealed by immunohistochemical demonstration of choline acetyltransferase. In contrast, the labeled projections to the olfactory, hippocampal, subicular, and entorhinal areas showed a heterogeneous morphology. Here, the distribution of only the thin varicose projections resembled the distribution of cholinergic fibers.},

  abstract = {A major driver of obesity is the increasing palatability of processed foods. Although reward circuits promote the consumption of palatable food their involvement in obesity remains unclear. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key hub in the reward system that encodes the hedonic aspects of palatable food consumption and participates in various proposed feeding circuits. However, there is still no evidence for its involvement in developing diet-induced obesity. Here we examine, using male C57bl6/J mice and patch-clamp electrophysiology, how chronic high-fat-high-sugar (HFHS) diet changes the physiology of the VP and whether mice that gain the most weight differ in their VP physiology from others. We found that 10-12 weeks of HFHS diet hyperpolarized and decreased the firing rate of VP neurons without a major change in synaptic inhibitory input. Within the HFHS group, the top 33\% weight gainers (WG) had a more hyperpolarized VP with longer latency to fire action potentials upon depolarization compared to bottom 33\% weight gainers (NWG). Weight gainers also showed synaptic potentiation of inhibitory inputs both at the millisecond and minute ranges. Moreover, we found that the tendency to potentiate the inhibitory inputs to the VP might exist in overeating mice even before exposure to HFHS, thus making it a potential property of being an overeater. These data point to the VP as a critical player in obesity and suggest that hyperpolarized membrane potential of, and potentiated inhibitory inputs to, VP neurons may play a significant role in promoting overeating of palatable food. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In modern world, where highly-palatable food is readily available, overeating is often driven by motivational, rather than metabolic, needs. It is thus conceivable that reward circuits differ between obese and normal-weight individuals. But is such difference, if it exists, innate or develops with overeating? Here we reveal synaptic properties in the ventral pallidum, a central hub of reward circuits, that differ between mice that gain the most and the least weight when given unlimited access to highly-palatable food. We show that these synaptic differences exist also without exposure to palatable food, potentially making them innate properties that render some more susceptible than others to overeat. Thus, the propensity to overeat may have a strong innate component embedded in reward circuits.},

  abstract = {Background Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective anticonvulsant device and has shown antidepressant effects in chronic treatment resistant depression. Because the vagus nerve sends information to brain regions important in anxiety regulation (locus coeruleus, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus and amygdala), this pathway might be involved in perceiving or manifesting various somatic and cognitive symptoms that characterize anxiety disorders. On the basis of this reasoning and reports of anxiolytic effects of VNS in patients treated for epilepsy and depression, we organized an open-label pilot acute trial of adjunctive VNS on top of stable medications, followed by long-term follow-up, to assess the safety and potential efficacy of VNS for patients with treatment resistant anxiety disorders. Methods Eleven adult outpatients with treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were recruited. Patients had failed several medication trials as well as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). All patients were rated with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the clinical global impressions improvement scale (CGI-I). Patients with OCD were also rated with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Patients were maintained on their current psychotropic medications at fixed doses during the acute 12-week phase. Changes in medications and VNS stimulus parameters were allowed during the long-term follow-up. Response was defined as a 50\% or greater improvement on the HAM-A for all patients and a 25\% or greater improvement on the Y-BOCS for patients with OCD. Results Eleven patients were recruited. Seven patients had a primary diagnosis of OCD, two had PTSD, and one had PD. One OCD patient changed their mind and was never implanted. One patient with OCD withdrew consent before the end of the acute phase, so long-term results were available for nine patients. Three patients were acute responders, based on the HAM-A, and there was some improvement in anxiety ratings over time (with statistically significant improvements at 14 of 18 quarters during long-term follow-up). Of the seven patients with OCD who received stimulation, three were acute responders, based on the Y-BOCS, and there was some improvement in Y-BOCS scores over time (with statistically significant improvements at 7 of 18 quarters during long-term follow-up). VNS was relatively well tolerated. Four years after implantation, four patients (diagnoses two OCD, one PD, one PTSD) were still receiving VNS with continued and sustained improvement in anxiety scores compared with their baseline scores. Conclusions These patients with treatment-resistant anxiety disorders generally tolerated VNS treatment, and there was evidence of acute and long-term improvement in some patients. These open data suggest that further double-blind studies assessing the VNS role in treating anxiety disorders, particularly OCD, may be warranted.},

The mechanisms underpinning the emotional dysregulation during abstinence are currently not well-understood. There is evidence suggesting a role of the neuropeptide oxytocin in the modulation of drug addiction processes. However, its involvement during long-term abstinence from cocaine use remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to behaviourally characterize a mouse model of long-term cocaine withdrawal and assess the effect of chronic cocaine administration and long-term cocaine abstinence on the central oxytocinergic system and the hypothalamic\textendash pituitary\textendash adrenal axis. Fourteen-day escalating-dose cocaine administration (3 \texttimes{} 15\textendash 30 mg/kg/day) and 14-day withdrawal increased plasma corticosterone levels and oxytocin receptor (OTR) binding in piriform cortex, lateral septum and amygdala. A specific cocaine withdrawal-induced increase in OTR binding was observed in the medial septum. These biochemical alterations occurred concomitantly with the emergence of memory impairment, contextual psychomotor sensitization and an anhedonic and anxiogenic phenotype during withdrawal. Our study established a clear relationship between cocaine abstinence and emotional impairment in a novel translationally relevant model of cocaine withdrawal and demonstrated for the first time brain region-specific neuroadaptations of the oxytocin system, which may contribute to abstinence-induced negative emotional state.},

  abstract = {The ultrasonic transducer industry is dominated by piezoelectric materials. As an emerging alternative, capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) offer wider bandwidth, better integration with electronics, and ease of fabricating large arrays. CMUTs have a sealed cavity between a fixed electrode and a suspended metalized membrane. Manufacturing cost and sensitivity are limiting factors in current CMUTs that depend on the fabrication equipment and, especially, on the materials used. For widespread use of CMUTs, a much lower fabrication cost that uses inexpensive materials, which maintain or improve upon existing sensitivity, is needed. Herein, a new fabrication process is described for polymer-based CMUTs (polyCMUTs) using~the photopolymer SU-8 and Omnicoat. The first ultrasound B-mode image of a wire phantom created with a 64-element linear array using synthetic aperture beamforming techniques is presented. A 12 VAC signal superimposed on a 10\,VDC signal was used on the transmission side, and only a bias-tee, with no amplifiers, was used on the receiving side. The low operational voltage and high sensitivity of this device can be partially attributed to a pre-biasing condition on the membrane. By using a novel sacrificial layer combined with a top electrode embedded inside the membrane, we demonstrated that SU-8 can be used to manufacture CMUTs inexpensively. Moreover, the~fabrication used relatively simple equipment, and the number of fabrication steps was reduced compared to traditional CMUT fabrication. This new fabrication process has the potential to increase the use of CMUTs in the ultrasound market, including the market for wearable transducers.},

  abstract = {The central amygdala (CeA) is critically involved in a range of adaptive behaviors, including defensive behaviors. Neurons in the CeA send long-range projections to a number of extra-amygdala targets, but the functions of these projections remain elusive. Here, we report that a previously neglected CeA-to-globus pallidus external segment (GPe) circuit plays an essential role in classical fear conditioning. By anatomic tracing, in situ hybridization and channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping in both male and female mice, we found that a subset of CeA neurons send projections to the GPe, and the majority of these GPe-projecting CeA neurons express the neuropeptide somatostatin. Notably, chronic inhibition of GPe-projecting CeA neurons with the tetanus toxin light chain (TeLC) completely blocks auditory fear conditioning. In vivo fiber photometry revealed that these neurons are selectively excited by the unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning. Furthermore, transient optogenetic inactivation or activation of these neurons selectively during US presentation impairs or promotes, respectively, fear learning. Our results suggest that a major function of GPe-projecting CeA neurons is to represent and convey US-related information through the CeA-GPe circuit, thereby regulating learning in fear conditioning. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The central amygdala (CeA) has been implicated in the establishment of defensive behaviors toward threats, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that a subpopulation of neurons in the CeA, which are mainly those that express the neuropeptide somatostatin, send projections to the globus pallidus external segment (GPe), and this CeA-GPe circuit conveys unconditioned stimulus (US)-related information during classical fear conditioning, thereby having an indispensable role in learning. Our results reveal a previously unknown circuit mechanism for fear learning.},

As a result, reactivated firing patterns occur within shorter time windows propitious for synaptic plasticity within the hippocampal network and in downstream neocortical structures. This is consistent with the long-held view that ripples participate in strengthening and reorganizing memory traces, possibly by mediating information transfer to neocortical areas. Recent studies have confirmed that ripples and associated neuronal reactivations play a causal role in memory consolidation during sleep and rest. However, further research will be necessary to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms of memory consolidation, in particular the selection of reactivated assemblies, and the functional specificity of awake ripples.},

Surprisingly, intracellular chloride was not primarily determined by transporters. Instead, subcellular gradients of immobile anions generated inverse chloride gradients.

CCC inhibition had modest effects on [Cl\textendash ]i and neuronal volume, but substantial changes were produced by alterations of the balance between [A]i and [A]o. Therefore, CCCs are important elements of Cl\textendash{} homeostasis, but local impermeant anions determine the homeostatic set point for [Cl\textendash ], and hence, neuronal volume and the polarity of local GABAAR signaling.

This may reflect the limited temporal resolution of imaging technologies or methodological variability. Processes also reflect the function of networks rather than isolated regions, so that the output of a region will differ as it connects with different networks.Although activity among PFC regions is highly integrated and flexible, such that any one region is involved in multiple functions, the dorsal PFC (including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC and inferior frontal gyrus) has been predominantly implicated in top-down control and meta-cognitive functions (including awareness), the ventromedial PFC (including subgenual ACC and medial orbitofrontal cortex) in emotion regulation (including conditioning and assigning incentive salience to drugs and drug-related cues), and the ventrolateral PFC and lateral OFC in automatic response tendencies (for example, drug-related attention bias) and impulsivity.Dysfunction of these PFC regions may contribute to impaired response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) in addiction, neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie the development of craving, compulsive use and impaired self-awareness (previously labelled 'denial' of illness and/or need for treatment), which are characteristic symptoms of drug addiction.PFC dysfunction may in some instances precede drug use and confer vulnerability for (or protection against) developing substance use disorders.Specific biomarkers could be targeted for intervention purposes. For example, PFC abnormalities could be used to identify the children and adolescents who would benefit most from intensive drug abuse prevention efforts.The combination of targeted pharmacological interventions (for example, to enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission) with cognitive\textendash behavioural exercises (for example, to enhance inhibitory control and non drug-related motivation, and reduce drug-related attention bias) could normalize select PFC functions.

This Ve field reflects population-level neural activity, but does it modulate neural dynamics and the function of neural circuits? We provide a cable theory framework to study how a bundle of model neurons generates Ve and how this Ve feeds back and influences membrane potential (Vm). We find that these ``ephaptic interactions'' are small but not negligible. The model neural population can generate Ve with millivolt-scale amplitude, and this Ve perturbs the Vm of ``nearby'' cables and effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable theory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the medial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brain stem. The MSO is a possible locus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large (millivolt scale) Ve in vivo in this nucleus. The Ve response is thought to be generated by MSO neurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal precision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location). Using a biophysically based model of MSO neurons, we find millivolt-scale ephaptic interactions consistent with the passive cable theory results. These subtle membrane potential perturbations induce changes in spike initiation threshold, spike time synchrony, and time difference sensitivity. These results suggest that ephaptic coupling may influence MSO function.},

This may have important implications for the interpretation of results obtained with this popular technology. Science, this issue p. 503 The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of ``designer receptors,'' which are exclusively activated by the ``designer drug'' clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system\textendash expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.

  abstract = {Gamma oscillations appear to be dependent on inhibitory neurotransmission from parvalbumin (PV)-containing gamma-amino butyric acid neurons. Thus, the abnormalities in PV neurons found in schizophrenia may underlie the deficits of gamma-band synchrony in the illness. Because gamma-band synchrony is thought to be crucial for cognition, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia may reflect PV neuron dysfunction in cortical neural circuits. Interestingly, it has been suggested that PV alterations in schizophrenia are the consequence of a hypofunction of signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs). Here, we review recent findings that address the question of how NMDAR hypofunction might produce deficits of PV neuron\textendash mediated inhibition in schizophrenia. We conclude that while dysregulation of NMDARs may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, additional research is required to determine the particular cell type(s) that mediate dysfunctional NMDAR signaling in the illness.},

  abstract = {The nucleus incertus (NI) is a distinct cell group in caudoventral regions of the pontine periventricular gray, adjacent to the ventromedial border of the caudal dorsal tegmental nucleus. Recent interest in the NI stems from evidence that it represents one of the periventricular sites with the highest expression levels of mRNA encoding the type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor, which has a high affinity for naturally occurring CRH, perhaps accounting for some of the extrapituitary actions of the peptide on autonomic and behavioral components of the stress response. However, almost nothing is known about NI function and hodological relationships. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic analysis of NI inputs and outputs using cholera toxin B subunit as a retrograde tracer and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin as an anterograde tracer. Our retrograde tracer experiments indicate that the NI is in a strategic position to integrate information related to behavioral planning (from the prefrontal cortex), lateral habenular processing, hippocampal function, and oculomotor control. Based on its efferent connections, the NI is in a position to exert significant modulating influences on prefrontal and hippocampal cortical activity, and the nucleus is also in a position to influence brain sites known to control locomotor behavior, attentive states, and learning processes. Overall, the present results support the idea that the NI is a distinct region of the pontine periventricular gray, and together with the superior central (median raph\'e) and interpeduncular nuclei the NI appears to form a midline behavior control network of the brainstem.

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairments. Brain oscillatory activity is critical for cognitive function and is altered in AD patients. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (A{$\beta$}) induces reorganization of hippocampal networks. However, whether fine changes in network activity might be present at very early stages, before A{$\beta$} overproduction, remains to be determined. We therefore assessed whether theta and gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling, which are known to be essential for normal memory function, were precociously altered in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological field potential recordings were performed using complete hippocampal preparations in vitro from young transgenic CRND8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice showed robust alterations of theta\textendash gamma cross-frequency coupling in the principal output region of the hippocampus, the subiculum. In addition we showed that, compared to controls, these mice expressed negligible levels of A{$\beta$}. Finally, these network alterations were not due to genetic factors as 15-day-old animals did not exhibit theta\textendash gamma coupling alterations. Thus, initial alterations in hippocampal network activity arise before A{$\beta$} accumulation and may represent an early biomarker for AD.},

To characterize human hippocampal theta, we examine the properties of theta oscillations throughout the anterior\textendash posterior length of the hippocampus as neurosurgical subjects performed a virtual spatial navigation task. During virtual movement, we observe hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 14\,Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displays oscillations at \textasciitilde 8-Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlates with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation. We also observe slower \textasciitilde 3\,Hz oscillations, but these signals are more prevalent in the anterior hippocampus and their frequency does not vary with movement speed. Our results converge with recent findings to suggest an updated view of human hippocampal electrophysiology. Rather than one hippocampal theta oscillation with a single general role, high- and low-frequency theta oscillations, respectively, may reflect spatial and non-spatial cognitive processes.},

Human research suggests that the binding of diverse stimuli into one attended percept requires phase-locked oscillatory activity in the brain. Even insects display oscillatory brain activity during visual attention tasks, but it is unclear if neural oscillations in insects are selectively correlated to different features of attended objects. We addressed this question by recording local field potentials in the Drosophila central complex, a brain structure involved in visual navigation and decision making. We found that attention selectively increased the neural gain of visual features associated with attended objects and that attention could be redirected to unattended objects by activation of a reward circuit. Attention was associated with increased beta (20- to 30-Hz) oscillations that selectively locked onto temporal features of the attended visual objects. Our results suggest a conserved function for the beta frequency range in regulating selective attention to salient visual features.},

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in awake, behaving mice to monitor the activity of dmPFC excitatory neurons throughout Pavlovian sucrose conditioning. We characterize five unique neuronal ensembles that each encode specialized information related to a reward, reward-predictive cues, and behavioral responses to reward-predictive cues. The ensembles differentially emerge across learning, and stabilize after learning, in a manner that improves the predictive validity of dmPFC activity dynamics for deciphering variables related to behavioral conditioning.

Historically most studies of these neurons have used electrophysiological recordings from implanted electrodes but optical methods, measuring intracellular calcium, are becoming increasingly common. Several methods have been proposed as a means to identify place cells based on their calcium activity but there is no common standard and it is unclear how reliable different approaches are. Here we tested three methods that have previously been applied to two-photon hippocampal imaging or electrophysiological data, using both model datasets and real imaging data. These methods use different parameters to identify place cells, including the peak activity in the place field, compared to other locations (the Peak method); the stability of cells' activity over repeated traversals of an environment (Stability method); and a combination of these parameters with the size of the place field (Combination method). The three methods performed differently from each other on both model and real data. The Peak method showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting model place cells and was the most robust to variations in place field width, reliability and field location. In real datasets, vastly different numbers of place cells were identified using the three methods, with little overlap between the populations identified as place cells. Therefore, choice of place cell detection method dramatically affects the number and properties of identified cells. We recommend the Peak method be used in future studies to identify place cell populations, unless there is an explicit theoretical reason for detecting cells with more narrowly defined properties.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In recent years, GABAergic neurons have been identified in the basal forebrain where cholinergic cortically projecting neurons are located and known to be important in mechanisms of cortical activation. In the present study in the rat, the relationship of the GABA-synthesizing neurons to the acetylcholine-synthesizing neurons was examined by application of a sequential double staining immunohistochemical procedure involving the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). In these double and adjacent single immunostained series of sections, the GAD+ and ChAT+ cells were mapped, counted and measured with the aid of a computerized image analysis system. Through the entire basal forebrain, there was no evidence for colocalization of GAD and ChAT in the same neurons. Instead, a large population of GAD-immunoreactive neurons is codistributed with ChAT-immunoreactive neurons and outnumbers them by a factor of two: approximately 39,000 GAD+ cells to 18,000 ChAT+ cells. Although the GAD+ and ChAT+ neurons lie intermingled within fascicles of the major longitudinal and transverse forebrain fiber systems in subregions of the basal forebrain, the GAD+ cells are more highly concentrated within different sectors of the pathways and regions than the ChAT+ cells. Although GAD+ neurons resemble ChAT+ neurons in certain regions, both being bi- or multipolar and, on average, medium-sized cells, the GAD+ neurons are, in the majority (51\%), small-sized cells ( {$<$} 15 {$\mu$}m in length) and as a population significantly smaller than the ChAT+ neurons. These results suggest that many GABAergic neurons may represent interneurons in the basal forebrain and potentially exert an inhibitory influence on adjacent cortically projecting cholinergic neurons. Medium- to large GAD+ cells, which resemble similar ChAT+ cells, are also present and represent the majority of the GAD+ cells in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, and olfactory tubercle, but represent the minority in the anterior and posterior substantia innominata and globus pallidus. Given their prominent size, such GABAergic cells may also exert an inhibitory influence outside the basal forebrain as projection neurons and potentially in parallel with cholinergic neurons, to certain regions of the cerebral cortex. Accordingly, GABAergic cells may be considered as constituents of the magnocellular basal nucleus and potentially important elements within the ventral extrathalamic relay from the brainstem reticular formation to the cerebral cortex. \textcopyright{} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Retrograde transport from this region of the mediodorsal nucleus was investigated using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated wheatgerm agglutinin in combination with peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical staining for glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase. A relatively large number of retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons are located in the basal forebrain, amounting to more than 7\% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells in this region. Moreover, retrogradely-labelled choline acetyltransferase-positive cells are interspersed among glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons, accounting for about 6\% of the total choline acetyltransferase-positive cell population in the basal forebrain. The glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive and choline acetyltransferase-positive retrogradely-labelled neurons are distributed throughout several regions of the basal forebrain, including the medial septum, the diagonal band of Broca, the magnocellular preoptic nucleus, the substantia innominata pars anterior, the substantia innominata pars posterior, and the globus pallidus where only a few retrogradely-labelled neurons were seen. The choline acetyltransferase-positive mediodorsal-projecting neurons are morphologically different from the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the basal forebrain, suggesting that those projecting to the mediodorsal nucleus are a small proportion of the cholinergic neuronal population in the basal forebrain. In the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, many retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells were found, amounting to more than 7\% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells in this region. These retrogradely-labelled glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons are distributed throughout the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus in a continuous line with those in the basal forebrain, including the lateral preoptic area, the medial preoptic area, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the anterior and dorsal hypothalamic areas. The highest percentage of mediodorsal-projecting GABAergic neurons is in the anterior lateral hypothalamus where more than 25\% of the total population of glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive cells project to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Overall, of the large population of retrogradely-labelled neurons in the basal forebrain and preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, a significant proportion are glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive neurons ({$>$}60\% in the basal forebrain and {$>$}30\% in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus), while the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons amount to a smaller percentage of the neurons projecting to the mediodorsal nucleus ({$<$}13\% in the basal forebrain and {$<$}2\% in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus). These results provide anatomical evidence of direct GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain and preoptic-anterior hypothalamic regions to the ``intermediate'' part of the mediodorsal nucleus in the cat. This GABAergic projection field could be the direct pathway by which the basal forebrain directly modulates thalamic excitability and may also be involved in mechanisms modulating electroencephalographic synchronization and sleep through the ``intermediate'' mediodorsal nucleus.},

  abstract = {The basal forebrain (BF) plays an important role in modulating cortical activity and facilitating processes of attention, learning, and memory. This role is subserved by cholinergic neurons but also requires the participation of other noncholinergic neurons. Noncholinergic neurons include {$\gamma$}-amino butyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons, some of which project in parallel with the cholinergic cells to the cerebral cortex, others of which project caudally or locally. With the original aim of distinguishing different subgroups of GABAergic neurons, we examined immunostaining for the calcium binding proteins (CBPs) parvalbumin (Parv), calbindin (Calb), and calretinin (Calret) in the rat. Although the CBP+ cell groups were distributed in a coextensive manner with the GABAergic cells, they were collectively more numerous. Of cells retrogradely labeled with cholera toxin (CT) from the prefrontal or parietal cortex, Parv+ and Calb+ cells, but not Calret+ cells, represented substantial proportions ({$\sim$}35\textendash 45\% each) that collectively were greater than that of GABAergic projection neurons. From dual immunostaining for the CBPs and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), it appeared that the vast majority ({$>$}90\%) of the Parv+ group was GAD+, whereas only a small minority ({$<$}10\%) of the Calb+ or Calret+ group was GAD+.

The results suggested that, whereas Calret+ cells predominantly comprise caudally or locally projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons, Parv+ cells likely comprise the cortically projecting GABAergic BF neurons and Calb+ cells the cortically projecting, possibly glutamatergic BF neurons that would collectively participate with the cholinergic cells in the modulation of cortical activity.

By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments, and verified that neurons in~the living mouse brain could follow the electric field~envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice.},

The ALM is connected bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and ventral anterior\textendash lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect. Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation across multiple brain areas.},

However, transection of the auditory nerves or removal of cochlear fluids eliminates the US-induced activity, revealing an indirect auditory mechanism for US neural activation. Our findings indicate that US activates the ascending auditory system through a cochlear pathway, which can activate other non-auditory regions through cross-modal projections.

  abstract = {Theta activity has been related to the processing of spatial information and the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory. The medial septum (MS) plays an important role in the control and coordination of theta activity, as well as in the modulation of learning. It has been established that increased serotonergic activity may desynchronize theta activity, while reduced serotonergic activity produces continuous and persistent theta activity in the hippocampus. We investigate whether serotonin acting on the medial septum could modify spatial learning and the functional relationship between septo-hippocampal and septo-mammillary theta activity. The serotonin was depleted (5HT-D) from the medial septum by the injection of 5,7 DHT (5,7- dihydroxytryptamine). Theta activity was recorded in the dorsal hippocampus, MS and mammillary nuclei (SUM, MM) of Sprague-Dawley male rats during spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Spatial learning was facilitated, and the frequency of the hippocampal theta activity during the first days of training increased (to 8.5Hz) in the 5HT-D group, unlike the vehicle group. Additionally, the coherence between the MS-hippocampus and the MS-mammillary nuclei was higher during the second day of the test compared to the vehicle group. We demonstrated that septal serotonin depletion facilitates the acquisition of spatial information in association with a higher functional coupling of the medial septum with the hippocampus and mammillary nuclei. Serotonin, acting in the medial septum, modulates hippocampal theta activity and spatial learning.},

However, it has remained unknown how ACh modulates hippocampal output. Here, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that ACh, by activating oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM) interneurons and therefore augmenting the negative-feedback regulation to the CA1 pyramidal neurons, suppresses the circuit from the hippocampal area CA1 to the deep-layer entorhinal cortex (EC). We also demonstrate, using mouse behavior studies, that the ablation of OLM interneurons specifically impairs hippocampus-dependent but not hippocampus-independent learning. These data suggest that ACh plays an important role in regulating hippocampal output to the EC by activating OLM interneurons, which is critical for the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that some synapses exhibit long-lasting synaptic potentiation in response to low frequency (1 Hz) stimulation, similar to long-term potentiation (LTP) following high frequency induction protocols. Here, the authors characterize a form of long-lasting synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 area following alternating, single pulse stimulation of the medial septum (MS) and hippocampal CA3 commissural fibers (MS-H LTP). In urethane-anesthetized rats, alternating single pulse stimulation of the MS and CA3 (50 pulses each at 0.5 Hz, 1,000 ms interstimulus interval [ISI]) produced gradual increases of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude in CA1 ({$\sim$}123\% of baseline), while MS or CA3 stimulation alone was ineffective. The fEPSP enhancement was long-lasting ({$>$}4h) and repeated episodes of alternating MS-CA3 stimulation tended to result in greater levels of potentiation than those elicited by a single episode. Surprisingly, ISIs of 500, 750, and 1,500 ms did not result in significant changes in fEPSP amplitude, while an ISI of 100 ms produced synaptic depression. MS-H LTP was resistant to systemic administration of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor antagonists (scopolamine, mecamylamine), but abolished by systemic MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or local CA1 application of AP-V (10 mM), indicative of a critical role of hippocampal NMDA receptors in this effect. Paired-pulse facilitation experiments revealed a gradually developing, significant inverse correlation between fEPSP enhancement and decrease in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a role of changes in presynaptic transmitter release. Together, these data demonstrate a novel form of long-lasting synaptic enhancement in CA1 neurons in response to low frequency activity in separate afferent systems, an activity that might mimic some aspects of natural discharge patterns during the acquisition or consolidation of memory processes in hippocampal circuits. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Furthermore, we find that the ITC clusters antagonize one another through mutual synaptic inhibition and differentially access functionally distinct cortical- and midbrain-projecting amygdala output pathways. Our findings show that the balance of activity between ITC clusters represents a unique regulatory motif that orchestrates a distributed neural circuitry, which in turn~regulates the switch between high- and low-fear states.

Because cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor activation on sensory gating and neuronal oscillations in rats. Methods Auditory sensory gating has been recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in anesthetized rats. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded from the hippocampus, medial septum, EC, and medial prefrontal cortex in anesthetized and freely moving rats. Effects of systemic administration of CB1 receptor agonist CP-55940 were evaluated on these parameters. Results CP-55940 significantly disrupted auditory gating both in the hippocampus and EC in anesthetized rats. Theta field potential oscillations were disrupted in the hippocampus and EC, with simultaneous interruption of theta-band oscillations of septal neurons. Administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM-251 reversed both the agonist-induced gating deficit and the diminished oscillations. In freely moving rats, CP-55940 significantly reduced theta and gamma power in the hippocampus, whereas in the EC, only gamma power was attenuated. However, novelty-induced theta and gamma activities were significantly diminished by CP-55940 in both the hippocampus and EC. Conclusions Our data indicate that activation of CB1 receptors interferes with neuronal network oscillations and impairs sensory gating function in the limbic circuitry, further supporting the connection between cannabis abuse and increased susceptibility of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders.},

  abstract = {Neurological and psychiatric disorders are frequently associated with disruption of various cognitive functions, but development of effective drug treatments for these conditions has proven challenging. One of the main obstacles is the poor predictive validity of our preclinical animal models. In the present study the effects of the {$\gamma$}-secretase inhibitor semagacestat was evaluated in preclinical in vivo electrophysiological models. Recently disclosed Phase III findings on semagacestat indicated that Alzheimer's disease patients on this drug showed significantly worsened cognitive function compared to those treated with placebo. Since previous studies have shown that drugs impairing cognitive function (including scopolamine, NMDA receptor antagonists and nociceptin receptor agonists) disrupt or decrease power of elicited theta oscillation in the hippocampus, we tested the effects of acute and sub-chronic administration of semagacestat in this assay. Field potentials were recorded across the hippocampal formation with NeuroNexus multi-site silicon probes in urethane anaesthetized male C57BL/6 mice; hippocampal CA1 theta oscillation was elicited by electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Sub-chronic administration of semagacestat twice daily over 12 days at a dose known to reduce beta-amyloid peptide (A{$\beta$}) level (100 mg/kg, p.o.) diminished power of elicited hippocampal theta oscillation. Acute, subcutaneous administration of semagacestat (100 mg/kg) produced a similar effect on hippocampal activity. We propose that the disruptive effect of semagacestat on hippocampal function could be one of the contributing mechanisms to its worsening of cognition in patients with Alzheimer disease. As it has been expected, both acute and sub-chronic administrations of semagacestat significantly decreased A{$\beta$}40 and A{$\beta$}42 levels but the current findings do not reveal the mode of action of semagacestat in disrupting hippocampal oscillation.},

Recent studies indicate that the hippocampus is affected in human depression, and antidepressant drugs induce hippocampal adaptive changes that are thought to be associated with their therapeutic action. In the present study, we investigated the action of various antidepressant drugs on the activity of the septo-hippocampal system, its oscillatory activity in particular. The acute effects of the norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and desipramine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine were evaluated. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBv), with simultaneous hippocampal EEG recordings of anesthetized rats. Systemic administration of reboxetine synchronized hippocampal EEG, resulting in a significant increase in power at theta frequency, and an increase in frequency and power of gamma-wave activity. Parallel to EEG synchrony, reboxetine induced or enhanced theta oscillation of MS/DBv neurons. Oscillatory frequencies of MS/DBv neurons were identical, and phase locked to the corresponding hippocamapal theta frequencies. Under the same experimental conditions, reboxetine induced a two-fold increase in extracellular NE (but not serotonin) levels in the hippocampus as revealed by microdialysis. Desipramine, but not the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, evoked responses similar to those of reboxetine regarding septo-hippocampal theta activity. The present findings indicate that even though both NE and serotonin reuptake inhibitors are clinically effective antidepressant drugs, their action on the septo-hippocampal oscillatory behavior is different. It is presumed that selective NE reuptake inhibitors could modulate various cognitive processes associated with hippocampal oscillatory activity.},

  abstract = {Current therapies for epilepsy consist mostly of pharmacological agents or invasive surgery. Recently, ultrasound (US) stimulation has been considered a promising tool for the noninvasive treatment of brain diseases, including epilepsy. However, in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a common form of epilepsy, neurophysiological and functional outcomes following US stimulation are not well defined. To address this, we developed a paradigm of transcranial pulsed US stimulation to efficiently suppress seizure activity in the initial/acute period in a kainate (KA)-induced mouse model of mesial TLE. Pulsed US stimulation inhibited acute seizure activity and either delayed the onset of or suppressed status epilepticus (SE). Kainate-treated mice that had received US stimulation in the initial period exhibited fewer spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) and improved performance in behavioral tasks assessing sociability and depression in the chronic period of epilepsy. Our results demonstrate that US stimulation in the acute period of epilepsy can inhibit SRSs and improve behavioral outcomes in a mouse model of mesial TLE. The present study suggests that noninvasive transcranial pulsed US stimulation may be feasible as an adjuvant therapy in patients with epilepsy.

Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the piriform (olfactory) cortex were recorded in the medial entorhinal cortex during behaviors associated with theta activity (active mobility) and were compared with those recorded during nontheta behaviors (awake immobility and slow wave sleep). Synaptic responses were smaller during behavioral activity than during awake immobility and sleep, and responses recorded during movement were largest during the negative phase of the theta rhythm. Systemic administration of cholinergic agonists reduced the amplitude of fEPSPs, and the muscarinic receptor blocker scopolamine strongly enhanced fEPSPs, suggesting that the theta-related suppression of fEPSPs is mediated in part by cholinergic inputs. The reduction in fEPSPs was investigated using in vitro intracellular recordings of EPSPs in Layer II neurons evoked by stimulation of Layer I afferents. Constant bath application of the muscarinic agonist carbachol depolarized membrane potential and suppressed EPSP amplitude in Layer II neurons. The suppression of EPSPs was not associated with a substantial change in input resistance, and could not be accounted for by a depolarization-induced reduction in driving force on the EPSP. The GABA(A) receptor-blocker bicuculline (50 microM) did not prevent the cholinergic suppression of EPSPs, suggesting that the suppression is not dependent on inhibitory mechanisms. Paired-pulse facilitation of field and intracellular EPSPs were enhanced by carbachol, indicating that the suppression is likely due to inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release. These results indicate that, in addition to well known effects on postsynaptic conductances that increase cellular excitability, cholinergic activation in the entorhinal cortex results in a strong reduction in strength of excitatory synaptic inputs from the piriform cortex.},

To assess possible TUS modulation of mental states, we investigated effects on subjective reports of pain and mood of sub-thermal TUS versus placebo applied to frontal scalp and brain of chronic pain patient volunteers. Methods With IRB approval and informed consent, subjects with chronic pain completed two visual analog scales for pain (NRS) and mood (VAMS/Global Affect), and their vital signs were recorded 10~min prior to, and 10~min and 40~min following exposure to either subthermal TUS (8~MHz) or placebo (in a double blind crossover study) using the 12L-RS probe of a LOGIQe ultrasound imaging machine (General Electric, USA). A physician, also blinded for TUS versus placebo, applied the probe (with gel) to scalp over posterior frontal cortex, contralateral to maximal pain, for 15 seconds. A second investigator operated the ultrasound machine, randomizing TUS versus placebo. The process was then repeated, applying the opposite modality (TUS or placebo). Results: Subjective reports of Mood/Global Affect were improved 10~min (P~=~0.03) and 40~min (P~=~0.04) following TUS compared with placebo. NRS pain reports slightly improved following TUS (P~=~0.07) at 40~min. Conclusion We found improvement in subjective mood 10~min and 40~min after TUS compared to placebo. TUS can have safe neurophysiological effects on brain function, and is a promising noninvasive therapy for modulating conscious and unconscious mental states and disorders. We suggest TUS acts via intra-neuronal microtubules, which apparently resonate in TUS megahertz range.},

RCMRglc was determined in 62 regions from brains of na\"ive rats which were placed into an empty operant chamber for 12 hr continuously, and rats trained to self-administer cocaine during 3 hr training sessions and subsequently placed into the operant chamber for 12 hr continuously with or without access to cocaine. Animals placed into the chamber without access to cocaine were examined 6 hr later, while animals allowed access to the 12 hr cocaine binge were examined either 6 or 72 hr post-cocaine. Metabolic activity was reduced during withdrawal in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, islands of Calleja region, basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, medial septum, piriform and cingulate cortices, rostral caudatoputamen, entopeduncular nucleus and the adjacent lateral hypothalamus, somatosensory, auditory, and motor cortices compared to the na\"ive state. These effects were usually more severe at 72 than at 6 hr after binge exposure, with intermediate values observed in cocaine trained animals without binge exposure. The response was negatively correlated with the amount of cocaine consumed during binge exposure in the striatum, olfactory tubercle, piriform, cingulate, somatosensory, and motor cortices. Thus, the amount of cocaine consumed can affect the extent of metabolic depression after sustained drug exposure. The pattern of regional effects suggests that mesolimbic and rostral extrapyramidal dopamine terminal regions and certain of their efferent pathways are preferentially affected during cocaine withdrawal. The reduction of basal metabolic rate observed in these brain regions during cocaine withdrawal may become more severe with time despite the apparent recovery of certain behavioral-motivational responses. \textcopyright{} Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-{$\beta$} proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.},

  abstract = {Information processing in the hippocampus critically relies on its reciprocal interaction with the medial septum (MS). Synchronization of the septo-hippocampal system was demonstrated during both major hippocampal activity states, the regular theta rhythm and the large amplitude irregular activity. Previous experimental and modeling data suggest that the MS provides rhythmic drive to the hippocampus, and hippocampo-septal feedback synchronizes septal pacemaker units. However, this view has recently been questioned based on the possibility of intrahippocampal theta genesis. Previously, we identified putative pacemaker neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and/or the pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation channel (HCN) in the MS. In this study, by analyzing the temporal relationship of activity between the PV/HCN-containing medial septal neurons and hippocampal local field potential, we aimed to uncover whether the sequence of events during theta formation supports the classic view of septal drive or the challenging theory of hippocampal pacing of theta. Importantly, by implementing a circular statistical method, a temporal lead of these septal neurons over the hippocampus was observed on the course of theta synchronization. Moreover, the activity of putative hippocampal interneurons also preceded hippocampal local field theta, but by a shorter time period compared with PV/HCN-containing septal neurons. Using the concept of mutual information, the action potential series of PV/HCN-containing neurons shared higher amount of information with hippocampal field oscillation than PV/HCN-immunonegative cells. Thus, a pacemaker neuron population of the MS leads hippocampal activity, presumably via the synchronization of hippocampal interneurons.},

According to the `cell assembly' hypothesis, transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms2,3,4. Accordingly, neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation5,6,7,8. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10\textendash 30\,ms, suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons9, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation10 and the time window for synaptic plasticity11, we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.},

We investigated oscillatory activity and correlations throughout the different states of levodopa-naive parkinsonism as well as ``Off\textendash On'' and dyskinetic states of DRT in the external globus pallidum (GPe) of tremulous (vervet) and rigid-akinetic (macaque) monkeys and in the internal globus pallidum (GPi) of the vervet monkey. We found that, although oscillatory activity of cells and interneuronal correlation in both pallidal segments increases after induction of parkinsonism with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine (MPTP) and decreases in response to DRT, important differences exist between the two pallidal segments. In the GPi, the fraction of oscillatory cells and relative power of oscillations were significantly higher than in the GPe, and the dominant frequency was within the range of 7.5\textendash 13.5 Hz compared with a range of 4.5\textendash 7.5 Hz within the GPe. The interneuronal correlations were mostly oscillatory in the GPi, whereas at least half are non-oscillatory in the GPe. We demonstrate that the tremor characteristics after exposure to DRT do not resemble those of the normal or the levodopa-naive state. Moreover, although DRT reverses the MPTP-induced neuronal changes (rate, pattern, and pairwise correlations), the balance between GPe and GPi fails to restore. We therefore suggest that this imbalance reflects additional abnormal organization of the basal ganglia networks in response to dopamine replacement and may constitute the physiological substrate of the limitations and side effects of chronic DRT.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Such a scenario is commonplace in collaborative research settings in many disciplines and may occur for a number of reasons, such as excluding research in order to provide the paper with a clearer focus, tell a particular story, or exclude negative results that do not fit the hypothesis. Our concern in this paper is less about the reasons for including or excluding data from a paper and more about distributing credit in this type of scenario. In particular, we argue that the notion `substantial contribution', which is part of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship criteria, is ambiguous and that we should ask whether it concerns what ends up in the paper or what is a substantial contribution to the research process leading up to the paper. We then argue, based on the principles of fairness, due credit, and ensuring transparency and accountability in research, that the latter interpretation is more plausible from a research ethics point of view. We conclude that the ICMJE and other organizations interested in authorship and publication ethics should consider including guidance on authorship attribution in situations where researchers contribute significantly to the research process leading up to a specific paper, but where their contribution is finally omitted.},

  abstract = {GABA(B) receptors are believed to play a role in rhythmic activity in the mammalian brain. The aim of our study was to examine the presynaptic and postsynaptic locations of these receptors in the medial septal diagonal band area (MS/DB), an area known to pace the hippocampus theta rhythm. Whole-cell patch recordings were made from parasagittal MS/DB slices obtained from the 16-25 day rat. Neurons were classified into GABAergic and cholinergic subtypes according to previous electrophysiological criteria. Bath application of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen in the presence of tetrodotoxin, and brief tetanic fiber stimulation in the presence of ionotropic receptor antagonists, provided evidence for the presence of postsynaptic GABA(B) receptor transmission to GABAergic but not cholinergic neurons. Bath application of baclofen, at concentrations too low to elicit postsynaptic activity in MS/DB neurons, significantly reduced the amplitudes of stimulus-evoked ionotropic receptor inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the paired pulse depression of these evoked potentials. Baclofen also significantly reduced the frequencies but not the amplitudes of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), indicating the presence of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors on GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals in the MS/DB. Baclofen, also at a concentration too low to elicit postsynaptic activity, reduced the frequencies and amplitudes of spontaneous IPSCs and EPSCs recorded in the presence of 200-400 nM kainate. Rhythmic compound IPSCs at theta frequencies were recorded under these conditions in some neurons, and these rhythmic compound IPSCs were disrupted by the activation but not by the inhibition of GABA(B) receptors. These results suggest that GABA(B) receptors modulate rather than generate rhythmic activity in the MS/DB, and that this modulatory effect occurs via receptors located on presynaptic terminals.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Information processing by neurons has been traditionally envisioned to occur in discrete neuronal compartments. Specifically, dendrites receive and integrate synaptic inputs while axons initiate and conduct spikes to distal neuronal targets. We report here in mice, using morphological reconstructions and electrophysiology, that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that control mammalian fertility do not conform to this stereotype and instead possess a single projection structure that functions simultaneously as an axon and dendrite. Specifically, we show that the GnRH neuron projection to the median eminence to control pituitary hormone secretion possesses a spike initiation site and conducts action potentials while also exhibiting spines and synaptic appositions along its entire length. Classical axonal or dendritic markers are not detectable in the projection process. Activation of ionotropic glutamate and/or GABA receptors along the GnRH neuron projection is capable of depolarizing the membrane potential and initiating action potentials. In addition, focal glutamate application to the projection is able to regulate the width of propagating spikes. These data demonstrate that GnRH neurons elaborate a previously uncharacterized neuronal projection that functions simultaneously as an axon and dendrite. This structure, termed a ``dendron,'' greatly expands the dynamic control of GnRH secretion into the pituitary portal system to regulate fertility.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We developed a neurofeedback paradigm targeting STN beta bursts and investigated whether neurofeedback training could improve motor initiation in Parkinson's disease compared to passive observation. Our task additionally allowed us to test which endogenous changes in oscillatory STN activities are associated with trial-to-trial motor performance. Neurofeedback training reduced beta synchrony and increased gamma activity within the STN, and reduced beta band coupling between the STN and motor cortex. These changes were accompanied by reduced reaction times in subsequently cued movements. However, in Parkinsonian patients with pre-existing symptoms of tremor, successful volitional beta suppression was associated with an amplification of tremor which correlated with theta band activity in STN LFPs, suggesting an additional cross-frequency interaction between STN beta and theta activities.},

The two classes of computational models often use either an oscillatory frequency or a firing rate that increases as a function of running speed. Yet it is currently not known whether these are two manifestations of the same speed signal or dissociable signals with potentially different anatomical substrates. We examined coding of running speed in MEC and identified these two speed signals to be independent of each other within individual neurons. The medial septum (MS) is strongly linked to locomotor behavior, and removal of MS input resulted in strengthening of the firing rate~speed signal, while decreasing the strength of the oscillatory speed signal. Thus, two speed signals are present in MEC that are differentially affected by disrupted MS input.},

  abstract = {Noradrenaline is an important neurotransmitter which regulates GnRH release from the median eminence in the female rat during both basal GnRH secretion and the preovulatory or steroid hormone-induced GnRH-mediated LH surge. However, it is not clear at which sites in the brain this predominantly stimulatory influence is exerted nor is it known which adrenergic receptor subtype(s) mediate(s) the effects of noradrenaline. In order to determine if the GnRH neurones in the septum-diagonal band-preoptic area and/or their axon terminals in the median eminence are direct targets for noradrenaline, immunohistochemical triple-labelling studies were conducted to localize simultaneously GnRH peptide, dopamine-{$\beta$}-hydroxylase and {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptor protein. The results show that about 80\% of all GnRH neurones examined contained patches of immunoreactive {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptor protein at or near the plasma membrane and that some of these {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptors were adjacent to dopamine-{$\beta$}-hydroxylase containing axons. The GnRH neurones which did not contain {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptors were preferentially located in the rostral portion of the septum and diagonal band while all GnRH neurones in the caudal septum, diagonal band and in the preoptic area expressed {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptors. In the median eminence, a few {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptor patches were seen in the external layer and these receptors were only rarely observed to be associated with GnRH containing axon terminals. The results suggest that the effects of noradrenaline on GnRH release are, at least in part, mediated by the activation of {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptors which are located on most GnRH perikarya while the median eminence is not a likely site at which GnRH release is regulated by {$\alpha$}1B adrenergic receptors.},

Here, we evaluate a strategy in which optogenetic activation of medial septal GABAergic neurons, which provide extensive projections throughout the hippocampus, is used to control seizures. We utilized the chronic intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, which results in spontaneous seizures and as is often the case in human patients, presents with hippocampal sclerosis. Medial septal GABAergic neuron populations were immunohistochemically labelled and were not reduced in epileptic conditions. Genetic labelling with mRuby of medial septal GABAergic neuron synaptic puncta and imaging across the rostral to caudal extent of the hippocampus, also indicated an unchanged number of putative synapses in epilepsy. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of medial septal GABAergic neurons consistently modulated oscillations across multiple hippocampal locations in control and epileptic conditions. Finally, wireless optogenetic stimulation of medial septal GABAergic neurons, upon electrographic detection of spontaneous hippocampal seizures, resulted in reduced seizure durations. We propose medial septal GABAergic neurons as a novel target for optogenetic control of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

Median raphe nucleus (MRN) desynchronizes hippocampal theta waves via activation of GABAergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB), a theta rhythm pacemaker. Increased hypocretin mediates stress responses in addition to the maintenance of wakefulness. Hypocretin receptors are abundant in the MRN, suggesting a possible role of hypocretin in modulating stress-induced theta rhythm. Our results indicated that the intensity of theta waves was enhanced by footshock and that a hypocretin receptor antagonist (TCS1102) suppressed the footshock-induced theta waves. Administration of hypocretin-1 (1 and 10{$\mu$}g) and hypocretin-2 (10{$\mu$}g) directly into the MRN simulated the effect of footshock and significantly increased theta waves. Co-administration of GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, into the MRN blocked the increase of theta waves induced by hypocretins or footshock. These results suggested that stress enhances the release of hypocretins, activates GABAergic neurons in the MRN, blocks the ability of MRN to desynchronize theta waves, and subsequently increases the intensity of theta rhythm.},

Animal studies have indicated that fear increases theta oscillations. Moreover, anxiolytics reduce reticular formation-elicited theta rhythms and theta blockade decreases anxiety. In this study, we hypothesized that the MRN mediates anxiety reduction caused by the theta blockade. Our results demonstrated that inescapable-footshock stimulation significantly increased the power of low-frequency theta oscillations (4\textendash 7Hz) in rats. Both the electrical stimulation of MRN and administration of bicuculline into the MRN successfully desynchronized footshock-induced theta oscillations.

  abstract = {Out of place channels drive seizures Focal cortical malformations (FCMs) develop in a group of diseases caused by mutations in the mTOR pathway. Patients often develop pharmacoresistant epilepsy; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying seizure occurrence are not completely understood. Now, Hsieh et al. performed in vitro and in vivo studies in a mouse model of FCM to understand the mechanism of seizure generation. The authors showed that ectopic HCN4 channels expressed in FCM neurons were responsible for seizure generation by depolarizing the resting membrane potential. Expression analysis in cortical tissue from patients with FCM showed increased expression of HCN4, suggesting that HCN4 could be targeted for treating seizures in patients with FCM. The causative link between focal cortical malformations (FCMs) and epilepsy is well accepted, especially among patients with focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, the mechanisms underlying seizures remain unclear. Using a mouse model of TSC- and FCDII-associated FCM, we showed that FCM neurons were responsible for seizure activity via their unexpected abnormal expression of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide\textendash gated potassium channel isoform 4 (HCN4), which is normally not present in cortical pyramidal neurons after birth. Increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations, which preferentially affects HCN4 gating relative to the other isoforms, drove repetitive firing of FCM neurons but not control pyramidal neurons. Ectopic HCN4 expression was dependent on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), preceded the onset of seizures, and was also found in diseased neurons in tissue resected from patients with TSC and FCDII. Last, blocking HCN4 channel activity in FCM neurons prevented epilepsy in the mouse model. These findings suggest that HCN4 play a main role in seizure and identify a cAMP-dependent seizure mechanism in TSC and FCDII. Furthermore, the unique expression of HCN4 exclusively in FCM neurons suggests that gene therapy targeting HCN4 might be effective in reducing seizures in FCDII or TSC. A cAMP-dependent mechanism mediates seizures in mTOR disorders due to the ectopic expression of HCN4 channels in diseased neurons. A cAMP-dependent mechanism mediates seizures in mTOR disorders due to the ectopic expression of HCN4 channels in diseased neurons.},

Indirect functional neuroimaging studies using PET or fMRI with fear-related stimuli support a PTSD neurocircuitry model that includes amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC).

The present study examined resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals in 25 active-duty service members and veterans with PTSD and 30 healthy volunteers. In contrast to the healthy volunteers, individuals with PTSD showed: 1) hyperactivity from amygdala, hippocampus, posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and insular cortex in high-frequency (i.e., beta, gamma, and high-gamma) bands; 2) hypoactivity from vmPFC, Frontal Pole (FP), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in high-frequency bands; 3) extensive hypoactivity from dlPFC, FP, anterior temporal lobes, precuneous cortex, and sensorimotor cortex in alpha and low-frequency bands; and 4) in individuals with PTSD, MEG activity in the left amygdala and posterolateral OFC correlated positively with PTSD symptom scores, whereas MEG activity in vmPFC and precuneous correlated negatively with symptom score. The present study showed that MEG source imaging technique revealed new abnormalities in the resting-state electromagnetic signals from the PTSD neurocircuitry.

  abstract = {The past decade has witnessed exponentially growing interest in the lateral habenula (LHb) owing to new discoveries relating to its critical role in regulating negatively motivated behaviour and its implication in major depression. The LHb, sometimes referred to as the brain's `antireward centre', receives inputs from diverse limbic forebrain and basal ganglia structures, and targets essentially all midbrain neuromodulatory systems, including the noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Its unique anatomical position enables the LHb to act as a hub that integrates value-based, sensory and experience-dependent information to regulate various motivational, cognitive and motor processes. Dysfunction of the LHb may contribute to the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, especially major depression. Recently, exciting progress has been made in identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the LHb that underlie negative emotional state in animal models of drug withdrawal and major depression. A future challenge is to translate these advances into effective clinical treatments.},

Although cholinergic and GABAergic MS-DBB neurons are known to modulate hippocampal activity, the role of recently described glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons is unknown. Here, we examined the electrophysiological properties of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons and tested whether they provide a functional synaptic input to the hippocampus. To visualize the glutamatergic neurons, we used MS-DBB slices from transgenic mice in which the green fluorescent protein is expressed specifically by vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive neurons and characterized their properties using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. For assessing the function of the glutamatergic projection, we used an in vitro septohippocampal preparation, electrically stimulated the fornix or chemically activated the MS-DBB using NMDA microinfusions and recorded postsynaptic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. We found that glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons as a population display a highly heterogeneous set of firing patterns including fast-, cluster-, burst-, and slow-firing. Remarkably, a significant proportion exhibited fast-firing properties, prominent Ih, and rhythmic spontaneous firing at theta frequencies similar to those found in GABAergic MS-DBB neurons. Activation of the MS-DBB led to fast, AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. These results describe for the first time the electrophysiological signatures of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons, their rhythmic firing properties, and their capacity to drive hippocampal principal neurons. Our findings suggest that the glutamatergic septohippocampal pathway may play an important role in hippocampal theta oscillations and relevant cognitive functions.},

Maladaptive changes in the neuromodulatory systems and neural circuits for reward and aversion can lead to manifestation of several prominent psychiatric disorders including addiction and depression. Recent progress is pushing the boundaries of knowledge on two major fronts in research on reward and aversion: First, new layers of complexity have been reported on the functions of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neuromodulatory systems in reward and aversion. Second, specific circuit components in the neural pathways that encode reward and aversion have begun to be identified. This review aims to outline historic perspectives and new insights into the functions of DA and 5-HT systems in coding the distinct components of rewards. It also highlights recent advances in neural circuit studies enabled by new technologies, such as cell-type-specific electrophysiology and tracing, and optogenetics-based behavioral manipulation. This knowledge may provide guidance for developing novel treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases related to the malfunction of the reward system.},

To explore this hypothesis, we have combined anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and retrograde tracing with wheat germ aggutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) to determine the efferent projections from the ILC. Axons exit the ILC in one of three efferent pathways. The dorsal pathway ascends through layers III and V to innervate the prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices. The lateral pathway courses through the nucleus accumbens to innervate the insular cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and parts of the piriform cortex. In addition, some fibers from the lateral pathway enter the corticospinal tract. The ventral pathway is by far the largest and innervates the thalamus (including the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, the border zone between the paraventricular and medial dorsal nuclei, and the paratenial, reuniens, ventromedial, parafasicular, and subparafasicular nuclei), the hypothalamus (including the lateral hypothalamic and medial preoptic areas, and the suprachiasmatic, dorsomedial, and supramammillary nuclei), the amygdala (including the central, medial, and basomedial nuclei, and the periamygdaloid cortex) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The ventral efferent pathway also provides descending projections to autonomic cell groups of the brainstem and spinal cord including the periaqueductal gray matter, the parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the dorsal motor vagal nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, and the ventrolateral medulla, as well as lamina I and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. The ILC has extensive projections to central autonomic nuclei that may subserve a role in modulating visceral responses to emotional stimuli, such as stress.},

Current optogenetic approaches require invasive surgical procedures to deliver light of specific wavelengths to target cells to activate or silence them. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-pressure ultrasound as a non-invasive trigger to activate specific ultrasonically sensitized neurons in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. We first show that wild-type animals are insensitive to low-pressure ultrasound and require gas-filled microbubbles to transduce the ultrasound wave. We find that neuron-specific misexpression of TRP-4, the pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel, sensitizes neurons to ultrasound stimulus, resulting in behavioural outputs. Furthermore, we use this approach to manipulate the function of sensory neurons and interneurons and identify a role for PVD sensory neurons in modifying locomotory behaviours. We suggest that this method can be broadly applied to manipulate cellular functions in vivo.},

Short-term memories are correlated with slow neural dynamics, including selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To determine the principles that underlie this persistent activity, here we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modelling. We show that during the delay epoch, the activity of ALM neurons moved towards discrete end points that correspond to specific movement directions. These end points were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other end point, followed by incorrect actions. Our results show that discrete attractor dynamics underlie short-term memory related to motor planning.},

We compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in male mice. Skilled, directional licking was the motor output. The anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) is necessary for motor planning in both tasks. Multiple features of ALM preparatory activity during the delay epoch were similar across tasks. First, most neurons showed direction-selective activity and spatially intermingled neurons were selective for either movement direction. Second, many cells showed mixed coding of sensory stimulus and licking direction, with a bias toward licking direction. Third, delay activity was monotonic and low-dimensional. Fourth, pairs of neurons with similar direction selectivity showed high spike-count correlations. Our study forms the foundation to analyze the neural circuit mechanisms underlying preparatory activity in a genetically tractable model organism. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Short-term memories link events separated in time. Neurons in the frontal cortex fire trains of action potentials anticipating specific movements, often seconds before the movement. This ``preparatory activity'' has been observed in multiple brain regions, but has rarely been compared systematically across behavioral tasks in the same brain region. To identify common features of preparatory activity, we developed and compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in mice. The same cortical area is necessary for both tasks. Multiple features of preparatory activity, measured with high-density silicon probes, were similar across tasks. We find that preparatory activity is low-dimensional and monotonic. Our study forms a foundation for analyzing the circuit mechanisms underlying preparatory activity in a genetically tractable model organism.},

Planning and execution are each associated with distinct patterns of motor cortex activity. Key questions are how these dynamic activity patterns are generated and how they relate to behavior. Here we investigate the multi-regional neural circuits that link an auditory 9go cue9 and the transition from planning to execution of directional licking. Ascending glutamatergic neurons in the midbrain reticular and pedunculopontine nuclei show short-latency and phasic changes in spike rate that are selective for the go cue. This signal is transmitted via the thalamus to the motor cortex, where it triggers a rapid reorganization of motor cortex state from planning-related activity to a motor command, which in turn drives appropriate movement.

However, systematic characterisation of speed representation is still lacking. In this study, we compared the speed representation of distinct cell types across sub-regions/layers in the dorsal hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex of rats during exploration. Our results indicate that the preferred theta phases of individual neurons are correlated with positive/negative speed modulation and a temporal shift of speed representation in a sub-region/layer and cell type-dependent manner. Most speed cells located in entorhinal cortex layer 2 represented speed prospectively, whereas those in the CA1 and entorhinal cortex layers 3 and 5 represented speed retrospectively. In entorhinal cortex layer 2, putative CA1-projecting pyramidal cells, but not putative dentate gyrus/CA3-projecting stellate cells, represented speed prospectively. Among the hippocampal interneurons, approximately one-third of putative dendrite-targeting (somatostatin-expressing) interneurons, but only a negligible fraction of putative soma-targeting (parvalbumin-expressing) interneurons, showed negative speed modulation. Putative parvalbumin-expressing CA1 interneurons and somatostatin-expressing CA3 interneurons represented speed more retrospectively than parvalbumin-expressing CA3 interneurons. These findings indicate that speed representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is cell-type, pathway, and theta-phase dependent.},

  abstract = {Background Temporal lobe epilepsy is most prevalent among focal epilepsies, and nearly one-third of patients are refractory to pharmacological intervention. Persistent cognitive and neurobehavioral comorbidities also occur due to the recurrent nature of seizures and medication-related side effects. Hypothesis Electrical neuromodulation is an effective strategy to reduce seizures both in animal models and clinically, but its efficacy to modulate cognition remains unclear. We hypothesized that theta frequency stimulation of the medial septum would increase septohippocampal oscillations, increase seizure threshold, and improve spatial learning in a rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Methods Sham and pilocarpine rats were implanted with electrodes in the medial septum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. EEG was assessed days prior to and following stimulation. Sham and pilocarpine-treated rats received either no stimulation, continuous (throughout each behavior), or pre-task (one minute prior to each behavior) 7.7 Hz septal stimulation during the Barnes maze spatial navigation test and also during assessment of flurothyl-induced seizures. Results Both continuous and pre-task stimulation prevented epilepsy-associated reductions in theta oscillations over time. Additionally, both stimulation paradigms significantly improved spatial navigation in the Barnes maze, reducing latency and improving search strategy. Moreover, stimulation led to significant increases in seizure threshold in pilocarpine-treated rats. There was no evidence of cognitive enhancement or increased seizure threshold in stimulated sham rats. Conclusion These findings have profound implications as theta stimulation of the septum represents a single frequency and target that has the potential to both improve cognition and reduce seizures for patients with refractory epilepsy.},

Here, we studied theta oscillations within the hippocampus (HPC)-amygdala (AMY)-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) network in exploration of a novel environment and subsequent familiarization through repeated exposures to that same environment; in addition, we assessed how concomitant stress exposure could disrupt this activity and impair both behavioral processes. Local field potentials were simultaneously recorded from dorsal and ventral hippocampus (dHPC and vHPC respectively), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and mPFC in freely behaving rats while they were exposed to a novel environment, then repeatedly re-exposed over the course of 3 weeks to that same environment and, finally, on re-exposure to a novel unfamiliar environment. A longitudinal analysis of theta activity within this circuit revealed a reduction of vHPC and BLA theta power and vHPC-BLA theta coherence through familiarization which was correlated with a return to normal exploratory behavior in control rats. In contrast, a persistent over-activation of the same brain regions was observed in stressed rats that displayed impairments in novel exploration and familiarization processes. Importantly, we show that stress also affected intra-hippocampal synchrony and heightened the coherence between vHPC and BLA. In summary, we demonstrate that modulatory theta activity in the aforementioned circuit, namely in the vHPC and BLA, is correlated with the expression of anxiety in novelty-induced exploration and familiarization in both normal and pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Path integration is a navigation strategy that requires animals to integrate self-movements during exploration to determine their position in space. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has been suggested to play a pivotal role in this process. Grid cells, head-direction cells, border cells as well as speed cells within the MEC collectively provide a dynamic representation of the animal position in space based on the integration of self-movements. All these cells are strongly modulated by theta oscillations, thus suggesting that theta rhythmicity in the MEC may be essential for integrating and coordinating self-movement information during navigation. In this study, we first show that excitotoxic MEC lesions, but not dorsal hippocampal lesions, impair the ability of rats to estimate linear distances based on self-movement information. Next, we report similar deficits following medial septum inactivation, which strongly impairs theta oscillations in the entorhinal\textendash hippocampal circuits. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a major role of the MEC and MS in estimating distances to be traveled, and point to theta oscillations within the MEC as a neural mechanism responsible for the integration of information generated by linear self-displacements.},

  abstract = {The theta oscillation is a neuroscience enigma. When a rat runs through an environment, large-amplitude theta oscillations (4\textendash 10 Hz) reliably appear in the hippocampus's electrical activity. The consistency of this pattern led to theta playing a central role in theories on the neural basis of mammalian spatial navigation and memory. However, in fact, hippocampal oscillations at 4\textendash 10 Hz are rare in humans and in some other species. This presents a challenge for theories proposing theta as an essential component of the mammalian brain, including models of place and grid cells. Here, I examine this issue by reviewing recent research on human hippocampal oscillations using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients. This work indicates that the human hippocampus does indeed exhibit rhythms that are functionally similar to theta oscillations found in rodents, but that these signals have a slower frequency of approximately 1\textendash 4 Hz. I argue that oscillatory models of navigation and memory derived from rodent data are relevant for humans, but that they should be modified to account for the slower frequency of the human theta rhythm.},

During the probe test in the water maze, performance of the lesion group decreased for measures of time spent and the number of swim crossings over the previous platform location. Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was decreased in lesion and implantation groups, whereas activity in the stimulation group was not different from the normal group. Hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in the stimulation group. Our results revealed that DBS of MS restores spatial memory after damage to cholinergic neurons.

We found that chronic pain activated MS cholinergic neurons and pyramidal neurons in the rACC, but suppressed pyramidal neuronal activities in the vCA1, all of which contributed to the maintenance of pathological pain. Chemogenetic inhibition of MS cholinergic neurons or the MS\textendash rACC pathway inhibited rACC pyramidal neuronal activities and attenuated perceptual and affective dimensions of chronic pain. By contrast, chemogenetic activation of MS cholinergic neurons also produced analgesia, but by rescuing hypofunctional pyramidal neurons in vCA1. These results clearly demonstrate that the MS cholinergic system differentially modulates chronic inflammatory pain through MS\textendash rACC or MS\textendash vCA1 pathways.

  abstract = {Hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been considered a possible cause for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. More recently, indirect ways to regulate NMDA that would be less disruptive have been proposed and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) represents one such candidate. To characterize the cell populations involved, we demonstrated here that knock-out (KO) of mGluR5 in cholinergic, but not glutamatergic or parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic, neurons reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and enhanced sensitivity to MK801-induced locomotor activity. Inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) resulted in reduced PPI further demonstrating the importance of these neurons in sensorimotor gating. Volume imaging and quantification were used to compare PV and cholinergic cell distribution, density, and total cell counts in the different cell-type-specific KO lines. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced NMDA receptor-mediated currents in cholinergic neurons of the medial septum in mGluR5 KO mice. These results obtained from male and female mice indicate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell type involved in sensorimotor gating and are relevant to pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating such as schizophrenia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The mechanistic complexity underlying psychiatric disorders remains a major challenge that is hindering the drug discovery process. Here, we generated genetically modified mouse lines to better characterize the involvement of the receptor mGluR5 in the fine-tuning of NMDA receptors, specifically in the context of sensorimotor gating. We evaluated the importance of knocking-out mGluR5 in three different cell types in two brain regions and performed different sets of experiments including behavioral testing and electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrated that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell-type involved in sensorimotor gating. We are proposing that pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating, such as with schizophrenia, could benefit from further evaluating strategies to modulate specifically cholinergic neurons in the medial septum.},

The ability to recollect episodic memory requires coordination of multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus (HPC) and the cingulate cortex. While the afferents into HPC and cingulate cortex that orchestrate the episodic memory remain unclear. The medial septum (MS), one of the anatomical location of cholinergic centers, innervates not only the dorsal HPC (dHPC), but also the cingulate and entorhinal cortices. By using ``What-Where-When'' episodic-like memory (ELM) behavioral model and viral tracing, we found that MS neurons projected to dHPC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which exerted distinct impacts on ELM recollection. Chemogenetic inhibition of the dHPC-projecting MS neurons disrupted ``What-Where-When'' ELM recollection as well as object location, object-in-place, and recency recognition memories recollection, while chemogenetic inhibition of the ACC-projecting MS neurons only disrupted ``What-Where-When'' ELM recollection. Moreover, neither dHPC- nor ACC-projecting MS neurons were involved in novel object recognition memory recollection or locomotor activity. Immunostaining showed that ACC- and dHPC-projecting MS neurons are partially overlapped populations. These findings reveal an unsuspected division of ELM processing and provide the potential mechanism that the recollection of episodic memory need the coordination of MS neurons projecting to dHPC and ACC.},

Interareal projections are mainly mediated by glutamatergic pyramidal cell projections; only few long-range GABAergic connections have been reported. Using in vivo recording and labeling of single cells and retrograde axonal tracing, we demonstrate novel long-range GABAergic projection neurons in the rat hippocampus: (1) somatostatin- and predominantly mGluR1{$\alpha$}-positive neurons in stratum oriens project to the subiculum, other cortical areas, and the medial septum; (2) neurons in stratum oriens, including somatostatin-negative ones; and (3) trilaminar cells project to the subiculum and/or other cortical areas but not the septum. These three populations strongly increase their firing during sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, communicating this network state to the septotemporal system. Finally, a large population of somatostatin-negative GABAergic cells in stratum radiatum project to the molecular layers of the subiculum, presubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and indusium griseum and fire rhythmically at high rates during theta oscillations but do not increase their firing during ripples. The GABAergic projection axons have a larger diameter and thicker myelin sheet than those of CA1 pyramidal cells. Therefore, rhythmic IPSCs are likely to precede the arrival of excitation in cortical areas (e.g., subiculum) that receive both glutamatergic and GABAergic projections from the CA1 area. Other areas, including the retrosplenial cortex, receive only rhythmic GABAergic CA1 input. We conclude that direct GABAergic projections from the hippocampus to other cortical areas and the septum contribute to coordinating oscillatory timing across structures.},

  abstract = {Seizures can occur spontaneously and in a recurrent manner, which defines epilepsy; or they can be induced in a normal brain under a variety of conditions in most neuronal networks and species from flies to humans. Such universality raises the possibility that invariant properties exist that characterize seizures under different physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we analysed seizure dynamics mathematically and established a taxonomy of seizures based on first principles. For the predominant seizure class we developed a generic model called Epileptor. As an experimental model system, we used ictal-like discharges induced in vitro in mouse hippocampi. We show that only five state variables linked by integral-differential equations are sufficient to describe the onset, time course and offset of ictal-like discharges as well as their recurrence. Two state variables are responsible for generating rapid discharges (fast time scale), two for spike and wave events (intermediate time scale) and one for the control of time course, including the alternation between `normal' and ictal periods (slow time scale). We propose that normal and ictal activities coexist: a separatrix acts as a barrier (or seizure threshold) between these states. Seizure onset is reached upon the collision of normal brain trajectories with the separatrix. We show theoretically and experimentally how a system can be pushed toward seizure under a wide variety of conditions. Within our experimental model, the onset and offset of ictal-like discharges are well-defined mathematical events: a saddle-node and homoclinic bifurcation, respectively. These bifurcations necessitate a baseline shift at onset and a logarithmic scaling of interspike intervals at offset. These predictions were not only confirmed in our in vitro experiments, but also for focal seizures recorded in different syndromes, brain regions and species (humans and zebrafish). Finally, we identified several possible biophysical parameters contributing to the five state variables in our model system. We show that these parameters apply to specific experimental conditions and propose that there exists a wide array of possible biophysical mechanisms for seizure genesis, while preserving central invariant properties. Epileptor and the seizure taxonomy will guide future modeling and translational research by identifying universal rules governing the initiation and termination of seizures and predicting the conditions necessary for those transitions.},

Parvalbumin-immunopositive Teevra cells show the highest rhythmicity among MS neurons and fire with short burst duration (median, 38~ms) preferentially at the trough of both CA1 theta and slow irregular oscillations, coincident with highest hippocampal excitability. Teevra cells synaptically target GABAergic axo-axonic and some CCK interneurons in restricted septo-temporal CA3 segments. The rhythmicity of their firing decreases from septal to temporal termination of individual axons. We hypothesize that Teevra neurons coordinate oscillatory activity across the septo-temporal axis, phasing the firing of specific CA3 interneurons, thereby contributing to the selection of pyramidal cell assemblies at the theta trough via disinhibition.

  abstract = {The neural substrate of memory The ability to form memory is an essential trait that allows learning and the accumulation of knowledge. But what is a memory? There has been a long history of searching for the neuronal substrate that forms memory in the brain, and the emerging view is that ensembles of engram cells explain how memories are formed and retrieved. In a Review, Josselyn and Tonegawa discuss the evidence for engram cells as a substrate of memory, particularly in rodents; what we have learned so far about the features of memory, including memory formation, retrieval over time, and loss; and future directions to understand how memory becomes knowledge. Science, this issue p. eaaw4325 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDThe idea that memory is stored as enduring changes in the brain dates back at least to the time of Plato and Aristotle (circa 350 BCE), but its scientific articulation emerged in the 20th century when Richard Semon introduced the term ``engram'' to describe the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Essentially, Semon proposed that an experience activates a population of neurons that undergo persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of the engram by cues available at the time of the experience induces memory retrieval. After Karl Lashley failed to find the engram in a rat brain, studies attempting to localize an engram were largely abandoned. Spurred by Donald O. Hebb's theory that augmented synaptic strength and neuronal connectivity are critical for memory formation, many researchers showed that enhanced synaptic strength was correlated with memory. Nonetheless, the causal relationship between these enduring changes in synaptic connectivity with a specific, behaviorally identifiable memory at the level of the cell ensemble (an engram) awaited further advances in experimental technologies. ADVANCESThe resurgence in research examining engrams may be linked to two complementary studies that applied intervention strategies to target individual neurons in an engram supporting a specific memory in mice. One study showed that ablating the subset of lateral amygdala neurons allocated to a putative engram disrupted subsequent memory retrieval (loss of function). The second study showed that artificially reactivating a subset of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons that were active during a fearful experience (and, therefore, part of a putative engram) induced memory retrieval in the absence of external retrieval cues (gain of function). Subsequent findings from many labs used similar strategies to identify engrams in other brain regions supporting different types of memory.There are several recent advances in engram research. First, eligible neurons within a given brain region were shown to compete for allocation to an engram, and relative neuronal excitability determines the outcome of this competition. Excitability-based competition also guides the organization of multiple engrams in the brain and determines how these engrams interact. Second, research examining the nature of the off-line, enduring changes in engram cells (neurons that are critical components of an engram) found increased synaptic strength and spine density in these neurons as well as preferential connectivity to other downstream engram cells. Therefore, both increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity work hand in hand to form engrams, and these mechanisms are also implicated in memory consolidation and retrieval processes. Third, it is now possible to artificially manipulate memory encoding and retrieval processes to generate false memories, or even create a memory in mice without any natural sensory experience (implantation of a memory for an experience that did not occur). Fourth, ``silent'' engrams were discovered in amnesic mice; artificial reactivation of silent engrams induces memory retrieval, whereas natural cues cannot. Endogenous engram silencing may contribute to the change in memory over time (e.g., systems memory consolidation) or in different circumstances (e.g., fear memory extinction). These findings suggest that once formed, an engram may exist in different states (from silent to active) on the basis of their retrievability. Although initial engram studies focused on single brain regions, an emerging concept is that a given memory is supported by an engram complex, composed of functionally connected engram cell ensembles dispersed across multiple brain regions, with each ensemble supporting a component of the overall memory. OUTLOOKThe ability to identify and manipulate engram cells and brainwide engram complexes has introduced an exciting new era of memory research. The findings from many labs are beginning to define an engram as the basic unit of memory. However, many questions remain. In the short term, it is critical to characterize how information is stored in an engram, including how engram architecture affects memory quality, strength, and precision; how multiple engrams interact; how engrams change over time; and the role of engram silencing in these processes. The long-term goal of engram research is to leverage the fundamental findings from rodent engram studies to understand how information is acquired, stored, and used in humans and facilitate the treatment of human memory, or other information-processing, disorders. The development of low- to noninvasive technology may enable new human therapies based on the growing knowledge of engrams in rodents. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/367/6473/eaaw4325/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint An engram cell alongside a nonengram cell.Within the hippocampus, dentate gyrus cells were filled with biocytin (white) to examine morphology. Engram cells active during context fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink owing to overlap with biocytin signals. Axons of the perforant path (green) express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin 2 and a fluorescent marker (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein).

RYAN ET AL., SCIENCE 348, 1007 (2015). In 1904, Richard Semon introduced the term ``engram'' to describe the neural substrate for storing memories. An experience, Semon proposed, activates a subset of cells that undergo off-line, persistent chemical and/or physical changes to become an engram. Subsequent reactivation of this engram induces memory retrieval. Although Semon's contributions were largely ignored in his lifetime, new technologies that allow researchers to image and manipulate the brain at the level of individual neurons has reinvigorated engram research. We review recent progress in studying engrams, including an evaluation of evidence for the existence of engrams, the importance of intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity in engrams, and the lifetime of an engram. Together, these findings are beginning to define an engram as the basic unit of memory.},

  abstract = {Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer from spatial memory impairment and wandering behavior, but the brain circuit mechanisms causing such symptoms remain largely unclear. In healthy brains, spatially tuned hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells exhibit distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called ``remapping.'' We tested remapping in amyloid precursor protein knockin (APP-KI) mice with impaired spatial memory. CA1 neurons, including place cells, showed disrupted remapping, although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons severely lost their spatial tuning and grid cells were almost absent. Fast gamma oscillatory coupling between the MEC and CA1 was also impaired. Mild disruption of MEC grid cells emerged in younger APP-KI mice, although the spatial memory and CA1 remapping of the animals remained intact. These results point to remapping impairment in the hippocampus, possibly linked to grid cell disruption, as circuit mechanisms underlying spatial memory impairment in AD.},

Projections from the MS were found to enter the basal mesencephalon at the rostro-medial aspect of the pontine nuclei, curve dorsally and terminate throughout the RCS and in the caudal portion of the NRD. Fibers from the VDB were found to enter these raphe nuclei by two separate routes; some fibers reached the basal mesencephalon, curved dorsally and terminated in the RCS and NRD. Other fibers entered the pedunculopontine nucleus, curved medially and reached the NRD. Presumed terminal labelling was found overlaying the RCS and NRD throughout their rostro-caudal extensions. The brain stem projections from HDB entered the mesencephalon by the same routes as those from VDB, but the labelling over RCS was sparse, and the NRD labelling was preferentially distributed to the rostral portion of the nucleus. The present data indicate a crude topographic organization of the projections from the septal region to the NRD and RCS. In general, the distribution of presumed terminal labelling appeared to be more closely associated with the distribution of NRD and RCS 5-HT immunoreactive cell bodies, than with the cytoarchitectonically defined extensions of these raphe nuclei. By sequential evaluation of the distribution of retrogradely labelled and acetylcholine esterase-stained cells on the same section, and by selective tracing with radiolabelled choline, it appears that the vast majority, if not all, of the neurons in MS and diagonal band which project to the rostral raphe are non-cholinergic.},

More specifically, biological mechanisms of epileptic states and state transitions are not well understood. Here, we explore the concept of the epilepsy as a manifestation of a multistate network composed of coupled oscillatory units. We also propose that functional coupling between neuroglial elements is a dynamic process, characterized by temporal changes both at short and long time scales. We review various experimental and modelling data suggesting that epilepsy is a pathological manifestation of such a multistate network \textendash{} both when viewed as a coupled oscillatory network, and as a system of multistate stable state attractors. Based on a coupled oscillators model, we propose a significant role for glial cells in modulating hyperexcitability of the neuroglial networks of the brain. Also, using these concepts, we explain a number of observable phenomena such as propagation patterns of bursts within a seizure in the isolated intact hippocampus in vitro, postictal generalized suppression in human encephalographic seizure data, and changes in seizure susceptibility in epileptic patients. Based on our conceptual model we propose potential clinical applications to estimate brain closeness to ictal transition by means of active perturbations and passive measures during on-going activity.},

Based upon this anatomical proximity, many investigators have been evaluating the possibility that these peptides may influence the function of the A10 dopamine neurons. A variety of experimental techniques have been employed in this regard, including anatomical, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral methodologies. Measurement of immunoreactive peptide levels with radioimmunoassay, and visualization of peptidergic neurons and fibers with immunocytochemistry has demonstrated not only that peptides exist in the vicinity of A10 dopamine neurons, but using double labeling techniques NT and CCK have been found to coexist with dopamine in the same neuron. Further, by combining retrograde tracing techniques with immunocytochemistry, the origin of some peptidergic afferents to the ventromedial mesencephalon has been determined. With the exception of CCK-8, microinjection into the ventromedial mesencephalon of rats with all the peptides or potent analogues produces a dose-related increase in spontaneous motor activity. For SP, NT and enkephalin the motor response has been blocked by dopamine antagonists. Further, an increase in dopamine metabolism in mesolimbic dopamine terminal fields is produced concurrent with the behavioral hyperactivity. These data indicate that SP, SK, enkephalin and NT can activate dopamine neurons in the ventromedial mesencephalon. This postulate is supported by electrophysiological studies showing an excitatory action by iontophoretic administration of peptides onto dopamine neurons. However, in some studies, excitatory electrophysiological effects were not observed. While some observations are contradictory, sufficient data has accumulated that tentative postulates and conclusions can be made about how these peptides may influence the A10 dopamine neurons. Further, speculations are offered as to the role this modulatory action may play in the many behaviors and pathologies thought to involve these dopamine neurons.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid plaques comprises one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rodents, acute treatment with amyloid-beta (A{$\beta$})(1-42) elicits immediate debilitating effects on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Whereas LTP contributes to synaptic information storage, information is transferred across neurons by means of neuronal oscillations. Furthermore, changes in theta-gamma oscillations that occur during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce LTP predict whether successful LTP will occur. Here, we explored if intra-cerebral treatment with A{$\beta$}(1-42) that results in LTP failure, also results in alterations of hippocampal oscillations that occur during HFS of the perforant path-dentate gyrus synapse in 6-month-old behaving rats. HFS resulted in LTP that lasted for over 24h. In A{$\beta$}-treated animals, LTP was significantly prevented. During HFS, spectral power for oscillations below 100 Hz ({$\delta$},\texttheta,{$\alpha$},{$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}) was significantly higher in A{$\beta$}-treated animals compared to controls. In addition, the trough-to-peak amplitudes of theta and gamma cycles were higher during HFS in A{$\beta$}-treated animals and the characteristic profiles of theta-gamma oscillations that accompany successful LTP induction were disrupted. These data indicate that alterations in network oscillations accompany A{$\beta$}-effects on hippocampal LTP. This may comprise an underlying mechanism through which disturbances in synaptic information storage and hippocampus-dependent memory occurs in AD.},

  abstract = {The medial septum (MS) plays an essential role in rhythmogenesis in the hippocampus (HIPP); theta-rhythmic bursts of MS neurons are believed to drive theta oscillations in rats' HIPP. The MS theta pacemaker hypothesis has solid foundation but the MS-hippocampal interactions during different behavioral states are poorly understood. The MS and the HIPP have reciprocal connections and it is not clear in particular what role, if any, the strong HIPP to MS projection plays in theta generation. To study the functional interactions between MS and HIPP during different behavioral states, this study investigated the relationship between MS single-unit activity and HIPP field potential oscillations during theta states of active waking and REM sleep and non-theta states of slow wave sleep and quiet waking, i.e., sleep-wake states that comprise the full behavioral repertoire of undisturbed, freely moving rats. We used non-parametric Granger causality (GC) to decompose the MS-HIPP synchrony into its directional components, MSHIPP and HIPPMS, and to examine the causal interactions between them within the theta frequency band. We found a significant unidirectional MSHIPP influence in non-theta states which switches to bidirectional theta drive during theta states with MSHIPP and HIPPMS GC being of equal magnitude. In non-theta states, unidirectional MSHIPP influence was accompanied by significant MS-HIPP coherence, but no signs of theta oscillations in the HIPP. In theta states of active waking and REM sleep, sharp theta coherence and strong theta power in both structures was associated with a rise in HIPPMS to the level of the MSHIPP drive. Thus, striking differences between waking and REM sleep theta states and non-theta states of slow wave sleep and quiet waking were primarily observed in activation of theta influence carried by the descending HIPPMS pathway associated with more regular rhythmic bursts in the MS and sharper MSHIPP GC spectra without a significant increase in MSHIPP GC magnitude. The results of this study suggest an essential role of descending HIPP to MS projections in theta generation.},

Using fMRI in mice, we mapped a discrete cortico-limbic loop between insular cortex (IC), central amygdala (CE), and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), which decomposes the affective value of a conditioned stimulus (CS) into its salience and valence components. In IC, learning integrated unconditioned stimulus (US)-evoked bodily states into CS valence. In turn, CS salience in the CE recruited these CS representations bottom-up via the cholinergic NBM. This way, the CE incorporated interoceptive feedback from IC to improve discrimination of CS valence. Consequently, opto-/chemogenetic uncoupling of hierarchical information flow disrupted affective learning and conditioned responding.

Here we show that female- and male-directed mounting in male laboratory mice are distinguishable by the presence or absence of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)2\textendash 4, respectively. These and additional behavioural data suggest that most male-directed mounting is aggressive, although in rare cases it can be sexual. We investigated whether USV+ and USV- mounting use the same or distinct hypothalamic neural substrates. Micro-endoscopic imaging of neurons positive for oestrogen receptor~1 (ESR1) in either the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or the ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision (VMHvl) revealed distinct patterns of neuronal activity during USV+ and USV- mounting, and the type of mounting could be decoded from population activity in either region. Intersectional optogenetic stimulation of MPOA neurons that express ESR1~and~vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) (MPOAESR1{$\cap$}VGAT neurons) robustly promoted USV+ mounting, and converted male-directed attack to mounting with USVs. By contrast, stimulation of VMHvl neurons that express ESR1 (VMHvlESR1 neurons) promoted USV- mounting, and inhibited the USVs evoked by female urine. Terminal stimulation experiments suggest that these complementary inhibitory effects are mediated by reciprocal projections between the MPOA and VMHvl. Together, these data identify a hypothalamic subpopulation that is genetically enriched for neurons that causally induce a male reproductive behavioural state, and indicate that reproductive and aggressive states are represented by distinct population codes distributed between MPOAESR1 and VMHvlESR1 neurons, respectively. Thus, similar behaviours that express different internal states are encoded by distinct hypothalamic neuronal populations.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic ability is important for locomotion, communication, and coordination between group members during the daily life of animals. We aimed to examine the rhythm perception and production abilities in rats within the range of a subsecond to a few seconds. We trained rats to respond to audio-visual stimuli presented in regular, isochronous rhythms at six time-intervals (0.5\textendash 2~s). Five out of six rats successfully learned to respond to the sequential stimuli. All subjects showed periodic actions. The actions to regular stimuli were faster than randomly presented stimuli in the medium-tempo conditions. In slower and faster tempo conditions, the actions of some subjects were not periodic or phase-matched to the stimuli. The asynchrony regarding the stimulus onset became larger or smaller when the last stimulus of the sequence was presented at deviated timings. Thus, the actions of the rats were tempo matched to the regular rhythm, but not completely anticipative. We also compared the extent of phase-matching and variability of rhythm production among the interval conditions. In interval conditions longer than 1.5~s, variability tended to be larger. In conclusion, rats showed a tempo matching ability to regular rhythms to a certain degree, but maintenance of a constant tempo to slower rhythm conditions was difficult. Our findings suggest that non-vocal learning mammals have the potential to produce flexible rhythms in subsecond timing.},

  abstract = {The development of current neuroleptics was largely aiming to decrease excessive dopaminergic signalling in the striatum. However, the notion that abnormal dopamine creates psychotic symptoms by causing an aberrant assignment of salience that drives maladaptive learning chronically during disease development suggests a therapeutic value of early interventions that correct salience-related neural processing. The mesolimbic dopaminergic output is modulated by several interconnected brain-wide circuits centrally involving the hippocampus and key relays like the ventral and associative striatum, ventral pallidum, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus reuniens, lateral and medial septum, prefrontal and cingulate cortex, among others. Unravelling the causal relationships between these circuits using modern neuroscience techniques holds promise for identifying novel cellular\textemdash and ultimately molecular\textemdash treatment targets for reducing transition to psychosis and symptoms of schizophrenia. Imaging studies in humans have implicated a hyperactivity of the hippocampus as a robust and early endophenotype in schizophrenia. Experiments in rodents, in turn, suggested that the activity of its output region\textemdash the ventral subiculum\textemdash may modulate dopamine release from ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in the ventral striatum. Even though these observations suggested a novel circuit-level target for anti-psychotic action, no therapy has yet been developed along this rationale. Recently evaluated treatment strategies\textemdash at least in part\textemdash target excess glutamatergic activity, e.g. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), levetiracetam, and mGluR2/3 modulators. We here review the evidence for the central implication of the hippocampus-VTA axis in schizophrenia-related pathology, discuss its symptom-related implications with a particular focus on aberrant assignment of salience, and evaluate some of its short-comings and prospects for drug discovery.},

Our study investigated the possible role of NMDA receptors of the medial septum nucleus (MS) and dorsal hippocampus (CA1) on memory acquisition in male Wistar rats. Animals were bilaterally implanted with chronic cannulae in the MS and CA1. Rats were trained in a step-through type inhibitory avoidance task, and tested 24h after training to measure step-through latency as memory retrieval. Our results indicated that pre-training intra-MS or intra-CA1 infusions of NMDA (0.125 {$\mu$}g/rat) and D-AP7 (0.012 {$\mu$}g/rat) increased and decreased memory acquisition, respectively when compared to saline control group. Also, pre-training intra-CA1 and intra-MS injection of an effect dose of D-AP7 (0.012 {$\mu$}g/rat) along with an effect dose of NMDA (0.125 {$\mu$}g/rat) impaired memory acquisition. Interestingly, pre-training intra-CA1/MS infusion of D-AP7 (0.012 {$\mu$}g/rat) diminished memory response produced by pre-training injection of NMDA (0.125 {$\mu$}g/rat) in the MS/CA1, respectively (cross injection or bilateral injection). Also, all above doses of drugs did not alter locomotor activity. These results suggest that the glutamatergic pathway between the MS and CA1 regions is involved in memory acquisition process.},

In contrast an intense noxious heat stimulus applied briefly to the distal end of the tail evoked a short duration increase in period of theta activation and suppression of pyramidal cell responses. With this acute stimulus the proportion of CA1 pyramidal cells excited (8/16) were similar to that suppressed (7/16). Finally, electrolytic lesions centred in the medial septal\textendash vertical limb of diagonal band of Broca (or septal region) prevented a noxious stimulus-induced theta and depression of CA1 pyramidal cell responses. Rather, in such lesioned animals noxious stimulation excited the majority CA1 complex spike cells studied (8/10). The above data are consistent with the notion that septohippocampal inputs are involved in noxious stimulus-induced CA1 pyramidal cell suppression. The formalin injection-induced selective activation of CA1 complex spike cells against a background of widespread pyramidal cell suppression might produce a ``signal to noise'' contributory to nociceptive processing in limbic structures. Such a processing might be involved in the affective\textendash motivational component of pain.},

In addition, MPO-S neurons responding to the Al noradrenergic cell group stimulation were characterized by examining their connections with the arcuate nucleus/median eminence (ARC/ME). With respect to stimulation of the Al noradrenergic cell group, a large proportion of MPO-S neurons exhibited one of the following three types of orthodromic responses: orthodromic excitation (OD + ), orthodromic inhibition (OD-), or complex orthodromic response (OD comp). The predominant type of response was OD +. Although E-P-priming did not change the relative proportion of neurons displaying a specific type of orthodromic response, it did increase the overall percentage of MPO-S neurons orthodromically responding to Al stimulation (39\% of MPO-S neurons responded to Al stimulation in the E-P-primed group whereas only 25\% of the neurons did so in the unprimed group). Neurons responsive to Al stimulation were more likely to respond orthodromically to ARC/ME stimulation than were those neurons which were unresponsive to Al stimulation. About one fifth of MPO-S neurons identified as projecting to the ARC/ME [putative luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons] orthodromically responded to Al stimulation. The predominant type of response was OD + . The present study indicates that Al noradrenergic input to MPO-S neurons is predominantly excitatory. Furthermore, the findings that (1) the proportion of neurons which responded to Al stimulation was increased by E-P-priming, a treatment used to induce a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in an OVX rat, (2) the neurons responding to Al stimulation had a tendency to receive input from the ARC/ME, a brain site intimately involved in the control of LH release, and (3) the activity of putative LHRH neurons was able to be affected by Al stimulation suggest that Al input to MPO-S area may be involved in the control of LH secretion.},

  abstract = {Although ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) nucleus is regarded as a center for sleep promotion, the exact mechanisms underlying the sleep regulation are unknown. Here, we used optogenetic tools to identify the key roles of VLPO astrocytes in sleep promotion. Optogenetic stimulation of VLPO astrocytes increased sleep duration in the active phase in naturally sleep-waking adult male rats (n = 6); it also increased the extracellular ATP concentration (n = 3) and c-Fos expression (n = 3\textendash 4) in neurons within the VLPO. In vivo microdialysis analyses revealed an increase in the activity of VLPO astrocytes and ATP levels during sleep states (n = 4). Moreover, metabolic inhibition of VLPO astrocytes reduced ATP levels (n = 4) and diminished sleep duration (n = 4). We further show that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), an ATP-degrading enzyme, plays a key role in mediating the somnogenic effects of ATP released from astrocytes (n = 5). An appropriate sample size for all experiments was based on statistical power calculations. Our results, taken together, indicate that astrocyte-derived ATP may be hydrolyzed into adenosine by TNAP, which may in turn act on VLPO neurons to promote sleep. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Glia have recently been at the forefront of neuroscience research. Emerging evidence illustrates that astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type, are the functional determinants for fates of neurons and other glial cells in the central nervous system. In this study, we newly identified the pivotal role of hypothalamic ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) astrocytes in the sleep regulation, and provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the astrocyte-mediated sleep regulation.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive brain stimulation of small animals plays an important role in neuroscience especially in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain disorders. Here, we report a miniaturized ultrasound transducer array designed for non-invasive brain stimulation of mouse for the first time. We designed and fabricated a Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) ring array that operates at 183 kHz in immersion. The fabricated transducer ring array exhibited a focal length of 2.25 mm and a maximum intensity of 175 mW/cm2. Because the array was fabricated in a ring shape, a natural focus was achieved and thus, no additional focusing circuitries or acoustic lens were required. Thus, a compact packaging was achieved with minimum surgical procedures for in vivo mouse experiments. Using the developed micromachined transducer array and simple packaging, we successfully induced the motor responses of a mouse. The success rate of ultrasound stimulation was quantified by recording the electromyography (EMG) signal during the stimulation. While the current ultrasound neuromodulation system is limited to acute experiments, the presented light ({$<$}; 1 g) and compact ultrasound neuromodulation system with a natural focus would enable chronic ultrasound neuromodulation experiments on freely-moving mice.}

Cells were classified into those which showed signs of a broadening of the repolarization phase of their action potential (`inflected': putative cholinergic) and those without (`non-inflected': putative GABAergic). Non-inflected cells tended to fire rhythmic bursts while inflected cells mostly fired in an irregular fashion, although still significantly phase-locked to hippocampal theta. In neither population did the phase-locked cells show any coherent distribution of their preferential phase. Sixty-five per cent of the rhythmically bursting cells showed a significant correlation between the interburst frequency and the animal's running speed.

In agreement with previously published work, \texttheta -related cells in the PH (12 cells) were all classified as tonic \texttheta -ON (increased tonic discharge rate during hippocampal \texttheta ), whereas those in the SuM (9 cells) and MM (15 cells) were all classified as phasic \texttheta -ON (rhythmic discharge, in phase with ongoing \texttheta ). The effect of RPO stimulation on cell discharge was tested after hippocampal \texttheta{} was abolished by infusion of procaine into the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band. The RPO-elicited discharge patterns of all PH tonic \texttheta -ON cells and all SuM phasic \texttheta -ON cells survived septal procaine infusion. Further, the discharge rate of PH cells and the frequency of burst discharge of SuM cells during RPO stimulation both increased after the infusion. In contrast, septal procaine infusion abolished the RPO-elicited rhythmic discharge pattern in MM phasic \texttheta -ON cells and attenuated their discharge rates. These results indicate that the PH and SuM form parts of an ascending system mediating hippocampal \texttheta, whereas the MM receives (and perhaps relays to other parts of the limbic system) rhythmic input descending from the septo-hippocampal system. In addition, PH and SuM receive descending inputs that limit the discharge rates of their \texttheta -related cells during hippocampal \texttheta.},

The effects of procaine infusion (0.5 {$\mu$}L, 20\% wt/vol) at various loci in the ascending system from pontine reticular formation to the medial septum/diagonal band area were investigated. It was found that procaine injected at points in the ascending system anterior to the supramamillary nucleus, in the region of the medial forebrain bundle or in the medial septum, reduced the amplitude of reticularly elicited RSA but had no effect on its frequency. Procaine injected at points in the ascending system from just anterior to the reticular formation stimulation site, up to, and including the supramamillary nucleus, reduced both the frequency and amplitude of reticularly elicited RSA. These results indicate that the frequency of reticularly elicited RSA is encoded in the supramamillary area, rather than in the medial septum/diagonal band as have previously been suggested.},

Double-labelling experiments revealed that these four antigen-containing cells formed distinct dorsoventrally running lamellae overlayed on top of each other similar to onion leaves. There was only a slight overlapping of the various cell groups. None of the four antigens were co-localized in the same cells. The lamella occupied by calretinin-positive neurons is situated at the border of the medial septum and the intermediolateral septal nucleus, and shows some overlap with the area occupied by cholinergic neurons. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from the hippocampus combined with immunostaining for calretinin revealed that calretinin-containing neurons do not participate in the septohippocampal projection. The lack of projection to the amygdala was also confirmed. Thus, calretinin-containing neurons represent a distinct cell group in the medial septal region, which either projects to subcortical areas, or may function as interneurons relaying hippocampal feedback to the medial septal projection neurons.},

Previous morphological and electrophysiological studies indicate that both the supramammillo-hippocampal and supramammillo-septal efferents contain excitatory transmitter. To test the validity of this assumption, transmitter specific retrograde tracer experiments were performed. [3H]d-aspartate was injected into different locations of the hippocampus (granular and supragranular layers of the dentate gyrus and CA2 and CA3a areas of the Ammon's horn) and septal complex (medial septum and the area between the medial and lateral septum) that are known targets of the supramammillary projection. Consecutive vibratome sections prepared from the entire length of the posterior hypothalamus, including the supramammillary area, were immunostained for calretinin, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin, and further processed for autoradiography. Radiolabeled, radiolabeled plus calretinin-containing, and calretinin-immunoreactive neurons were plotted at six different oro-caudal levels of the supramammillary area. The results demonstrated that following both hippocampal and septal injection of the tracer, the majority of the retrogradely radiolabeled (glutamatergic/aspartatergic) cells are immunoreactive for calretinin. However, non-radiolabeled calretinin-containing neurons and radiolabeled calretinin-immunonegative cells were also seen, albeit at a much lower density. These observations clearly indicate the presence of glutamatergic/aspartatergic projections to both the hippocampus and septal complex. It may be assumed that this transmitter could play a role in hippocampal theta rhythm generation/regulation.},

We investigated this by identifying axonal projections using optogenetics during large-scale recordings from the rat subiculum, the major hippocampal output structure. Subicular neurons demonstrated a noise-resistant representation of place, speed, and trajectory, which was as accurate as or even more accurate than that of hippocampal CA1 neurons. Speed- and trajectory-dependent firings were most prominent in neurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex and nucleus accumbens, respectively. Place-related firing was uniformly observed in neurons targeting the retrosplenial cortex, nucleus accumbens, anteroventral thalamus, and medial mammillary body. Theta oscillations and sharp-wave/ripples tightly controlled the firing of projection neurons in a target region\textendash specific manner. In conclusion, the dorsal subiculum robustly routes diverse navigation-associated information to downstream areas.

However, there is little evidence that oscillatory brain stimulation can modulate the cortical control of muscle activities during gait, which can be assessed using coherence analysis of paired surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gait-combined transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the gait cycle frequency on the cortical control of muscle activities during gait using EMG-EMG coherence analysis. Fourteen healthy young adults participated in this study. All participants underwent 2 test conditions (real tACS and sham stimulation over the leg area of the primary motor cortex during 10-min treadmill walking). The average peak-to-peak amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the tibialis anterior (TA) and lateral gastrocnemius muscles in the sitting position and EMG-EMG coherences in the TA muscle, triceps surae muscles, quadriceps muscles, and hamstring muscles during gait were measured before and after stimulation. Entrainment effect was significantly higher during real tACS than during sham stimulation. After real tACS, the MEP amplitude and beta band (13\textendash 33 Hz) coherence area increased in the TA muscle. The change in MEP amplitude from the TA muscle was positively correlated with the change in beta band coherence area in the TA muscle. Gait-combined tACS can modulate the strength of descending neural drive to TA motoneurons during gait. This suggests that oscillatory brain stimulation is a useful therapeutic tool to modulate the cortical control of muscle activities during gait.},

Special attention is paid to the role of damage of septal and hippocampal GABAergic cells in theta activity abnormalities. We also compare differences between native (in vivo) theta oscillations with those obtained in in vitro preparations of hippocampus and medial septum and find that in vitro they resemble epileptiform activity in some respects.},

In the control, the bursts of spikes in one group of rhythmic MSDB neurons phase-locked to the top of theta waves in the hippocampus, and in the second group, to the trough of these waves. The stimulation evoked seizure afterdischarges in the hippocampus and seizure bursts of spikes separated by periods of inhibition in MSDB neurons. In the first group of septal cells, seizure bursts coincided with inhibitory periods between afterdischarges in the hippocampus; in the second group, these bursts were observed during seizure afterdischarges, suggesting that different MSDB cells play opposite roles in the development of seizures. Evoked afterdischarges were spontaneously followed by recurrent ictal events; neuronal oscillations at the theta (6\textendash 7~Hz) or ``twice-theta'' frequency (12\textendash 14~Hz) preceded these secondary epileptic discharges. As a result of kindling, interictal spikes were recorded in the hippocampus; at the same time, synchronous bursts of many cells appeared in the MSDB. In the epileptic brain, the frequency of both the hippocampal theta rhythm and MSDB neuronal theta bursts increased; in the septum, an augmentation of neuronal rhythmicity was also observed. Theta oscillations, either spontaneous or evoked by sensory stimulation, abolished the epileptiform events. Evidently, the activities within the theta range during preictal and interictal periods are of different significance in the generation of seizures.},

  abstract = {Background Hippocampal oscillations play a critical role in the ontogeny of allocentric memory in rodents. During the critical period for memory development, hippocampal theta is the driving force behind the temporal coordination of neuronal ensembles underpinning spatial memory. While known that hippocampal oscillations are necessary for normal spatial cognition, whether disrupted hippocampal oscillatory activity during the critical period impairs long-term spatial memory is unknown. Here we investigated whether disruption of normal hippocampal rhythms during the critical period have enduring effects on allocentric memory in rodents. Objective/hypothesis We hypothesized that disruption of hippocampal oscillations via artificial regulation of the medial septum during the critical period for memory development results in long-standing deficits in spatial cognition. Methods After demonstrating that pan-neuronal medial septum (MS) optogenetic stimulation (465~nm activated) regulated hippocampal oscillations in weanling rats we used a random pattern of stimulation frequencies to disrupt hippocampal theta rhythms for either 1Hr or 5hr a day between postnatal (P) days 21\textendash 25. Non-stimulated and yellow light-stimulated (590~nm) rats served as controls. At P50-60 all rats were tested for spatial cognition in the active avoidance task. Rats were then sacrificed, and the MS and hippocampus assessed for cell loss. Power spectrum density of the MS and hippocampus, coherences and voltage correlations between MS and hippocampus were evaluated at baseline for a range of stimulation frequencies from 0.5 to 110~Hz and during disruptive hippocampal stimulation. Unpaired t-tests and ANOVA were used to compare oscillatory parameters, behavior and cell density in all animals. Results Non-selective optogenetic stimulation of the MS in P21 rats resulted in precise regulation of hippocampal oscillations with 1:1 entrainment between stimulation frequency (0.5\textendash 110~Hz) and hippocampal local field potentials. Across bandwidths MS stimulation increased power, coherence and voltage correlation at all frequencies whereas the disruptive stimulation increased power and reduced coherence and voltage correlations with most statistical measures highly significant (p~{$<~$}0.001, following correction for false detection). Rats receiving disruptive hippocampal stimulation during the critical period for memory development for either 1Hr or 5hr had marked impairment in spatial learning as measured in active avoidance test compared to non-stimulated or yellow light-control rats (p~{$<~$}0.001). No cell loss was measured between the blue-stimulated and non-stimulated or yellow light-stimulated controls in either the MS or hippocampus. Conclusion The results demonstrated that robust regulation of hippocampal oscillations can be achieved with non-selective optogenetic stimulation of the MS in rat pups. A disruptive hippocampal stimulation protocol, which markedly increases power and reduces coherence and voltage correlations between the MS and hippocampus during the critical period of memory development, results in long-standing spatial cognitive deficits. This spatial cognitive impairment is not a result of optogenetic stimulation-induced cell loss.},

Synaptic plasticity in the neocortex, dHipp, ventral Hipp (vHipp), and BLA has also been implicated in fear and extinction memory. This finding raises the possibility that basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons, the predominant source of acetylcholine in these brain regions, have an important role in mediating fear and extinction memory. While empirical studies support this hypothesis, there are interesting inconsistencies among these studies that raise questions about how best to define the role of BF cholinergic neurons in fear and extinction memory. Nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA are critical for fear memory and contextual fear extinction memory. NBM cholinergic neurons that project to the neocortex are critical for cued and contextual fear conditioned suppression, but are not critical for fear memory in other behavioral paradigms and in the inhibitory avoidance paradigm may even inhibit contextual fear memory formation. Medial septum and diagonal band of Broca cholinergic neurons are critical for contextual fear memory and acquisition of cued fear extinction. Thus, even though the results of previous studies suggest BF cholinergic neurons modulate fear and extinction memory, inconsistent findings among these studies necessitates more research to better define the neural circuits and molecular processes through which BF cholinergic neurons modulate fear and extinction memory. Furthermore, studies determining if BF cholinergic neurons can be manipulated in such a manner so as to treat excessive fear in anxiety disorders are needed.},

Twenty-nine of 170 cells were found to discharge synchronously with the theta rhythm of the hippocampus (theta- related neurons). All of the 29 theta-related cells were localized to the SUM or MB. A subset of theta-related cells of SUM and MB discharged in short-duration bursts comparable to the pyramidal complex spike cells of the hippocampus. In contrast to hippocampal complex spikes, however, which predominantly exhibit this mode of firing during non- theta states, the burst firing of SUM/MB cells was strongly correlated with the theta rhythm. The proportion of bursting neurons was higher in MB than in SUM. Using partial coherence analysis, we examined the relationship between SUM/MB theta-related cells and the two generators of theta of the dorsal hippocampus. The theta-related cells of MB showed a stronger correlation with ``CA1'' than with ``dentate'' theta, whereas no such asymmetry was found in the relationship between neuronal firing of SUM cells and the two generators of theta in the hippocampus. The foregoing suggests that the theta-related cells of MB are driven by descending projections from the hippocampal formation (CA1), whereas those of the SUM are not. The SUM and MB are intimately connected with the hippocampal formation--the SUM mainly via ascending projections to the dentate gyrus, and the MB via direct descending projections from the subiculum. Theta-related SUM/MB cells may be directly involved in the generation of theta and/or the transfer of theta rhythmicity to various parts of the limbic system and forebrain.},

With the 5-HT7 antagonist SB 269970, the 8-OH-DPAT-induced acquisition deficit seemed attenuated, but there was no subsequent retention. When infused immediately, 1, 4, or 6 h after each acquisition session, 8-OH-DPAT did not hinder consolidation. When the infusions were performed 2 h postacquisition, however, consolidation was disrupted. Finally, when infused before a probe trial after drug-free acquisition, 8-OH-DPAT had no effect, suggesting no interference with retrieval processes. We also established that 8-OH-DPAT had no effects when the platform was visible, and altered neither home-cage activity nor anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus-maze). Altogether, these results show that 5-HT1A receptors in the septal region contribute both to declarative-like information encoding and subsequently, within a given postacquisition time window, to its consolidation. They do not participate in the retrieval of recently learned declarative-like information. These observations suggest that 5-HT1A receptors of the medial septum contribute to a serotonin-mediated mechanism involved in the encoding and consolidation, not the retrieval of spatial hippocampal-dependent knowledge. These results might have some relevance to approaches aimed at modifying serotonergic functions in the brain for the treatment of disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and amnesia.},

Precisely timed neural activity within single cells or local networks is thus required for periodic spatial firing but not for single place fields.

We investigated whether rhythmic transcranial brain stimulation over the cerebellum could alter walking rhythm. Fourteen healthy subjects performed over-ground walking for 10 min during which they were given, in a random order, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left cerebellum at the approximated frequency of their gait cycle, tACS over the skin of the scalp, and during sham stimulation. Cerebellar tACS showed a significant entrainment of gait rhythm compared with the control conditions. When the direction of the tACS currents was symmetrically inverted, some subjects showed entrainment at an approximately 180\textdegree{} inverted phase, suggesting that gait modulation is dependent on current orientation. These findings indicate that tACS over cerebellum can modulate gait generation system in cerebellum and become an innovative approach for the recovery of locomotion in patients with gait disturbances caused by CNS disorders.},

The patients often show reduced hip and knee joint flexion and ankle dorsiflexion of the lower limbs during the swing phase of gait, which is partly controlled by the primary motor cortex (M1). In the present study, we investigated whether gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation targeting swing phase-related M1 activity can improve gait function in poststroke patients.Methods\textemdash Eleven poststroke patients in the chronic phase participated in this single-blind crossover study. Each patient received oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation over the affected M1 foot area and sham stimulation during treadmill gait. The brain stimulation was synchronized with individual gait rhythm, and the electrical current peaks reached immediately before initiation of the swing phase of the paretic lower limb. Ankle dorsiflexion was assisted by electrical neuromuscular stimulation in both real and sham conditions.Results\textemdash Regarding the effects of a single intervention, the speed of self-paced gait was significantly increased after oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation, but not after sham stimulation (paired t test, P=0.009). After we administered the intervention repeatedly, self- and maximally paced gait speed and timed up and go test performance were significantly improved (self-paced: F(1,21)=8.91, P=0.007, maximally paced: F(1,21)=7.09, P=0.015 and timed up and go test: F(1,21)=12.27, P=0.002), along with improved balance function and increased joint flexion of the paretic limbs during gait.Conclusions\textemdash These findings suggest that rhythmic brain stimulation synchronized with gait rhythm might be a promising approach to induce gait recovery in poststroke patients.Clinical Trial Registration\textemdash URL: https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/.

The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula, including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala.

In contrast to optogenetic interventions, transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) does not require cellular modification of neurons to be effective, and it is less invasive compared to deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, on-demand TES of targeted brain regions allows the potential for normal function of these networks during interictal periods, a possibility that is eliminated by resective surgical treatment approaches. To further explore the translation of closed-loop TES for treatment of epilepsy, we show here for the first time that unsupervised closed-loop TES in rats can consistently interrupt seizures for 6 weeks and has the potential to control seizure activity up to 4 months (longest periods examined). On-demand TES significantly reduced the time spent in seizure and the individual seizure duration, although significantly higher seizure rate was observed during the treatment. The 6 week long stimulation had no residual adverse effects on the electrophysiologic characteristics of the brain after the termination of the treatment and did not induce glial remodelling in the brain. Our findings demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive, potentially lifelong TES treatment of epilepsy either alone or as a complement to drug treatments.},

Advances in engineering and imaging along with an improved understanding of brain disorders are poised to reshape how DBS is viewed and delivered to patients. Breakthroughs in electrode and battery designs, stimulation paradigms, closed-loop and on-demand stimulation, and sensing technologies are expected to enhance the efficacy and tolerability of DBS. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the technical development of DBS, from its origins to its future.

GABAA receptors are present on the perikarya of cholinergic and GABAergic septo-hippocampal (SH) projections. The current experiments determined whether GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABAA receptor activation. Experiment 1 tested whether combining septal co-infusions of subeffective doses of muscimol with scopolamine, a drug that selectively influences GABA SH projections, would produce memory deficits. Experiment 2 tested whether hippocampal infusions of a GABAA receptor antagonist would block the effects of septal muscimol infusions. Fifteen minutes prior to assessing spontaneous alternation (SA) or training in a multiple trial inhibitory avoidance (CMIA) task, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given septal infusions of vehicle, muscimol, scopolamine, or co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine, or septal infusions of vehicle or muscimol combined with hippocampal infusions of vehicle or bicuculline. Septal co-infusions of muscimol with scopolamine significantly impaired SA and CMIA. Hippocampal bicuculline infusions blocked deficits produced by septal muscimol infusions in SA and attenuated deficits produced in CMIA. Combined, these findings suggest that GABAergic SH projections are involved in the memory-impairing effects of septal GABA receptor activation.

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown remarkable therapeutic benefits for patients with otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective disorders, such as chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia. Yet the precise mechanisms of action for DBS remain uncertain. Here we give an up-to-date overview of the principles of DBS, its neural mechanisms and its potential future applications.DBS directly changes brain activity in a controlled manner and, unlike those of lesioning techniques, its effects are reversible. Furthermore, DBS is the only neurosurgical technique that allows blinded studies. New targets for DBS have been discovered through the use of translational research, and in particular through highly successful rodent and primate models of movement disorders.DBS of both the normal and the diseased brain fundamentally depends on a number of parameters, including the physiological properties of the brain tissue, which may change with disease state, the stimulation parameters, including amplitude and temporal characteristics, and the geometric configuration of the electrode and the surrounding tissue.In vivo neurophysiological recordings of activity from a deep brain electrode in one brain region, made while stimulating another brain region, have shown that DBS modulates the pathological oscillatory activity between brain regions.Results from animal experiments have also shown that DBS appears to elicit neurotransmitter release in downstream brain structures, although there is conflicting evidence from human studies.Functional neuroimaging methods can be used to elucidate the whole-brain responses elicited by DBS, and on the whole they have confirmed the findings from recordings in other animals. However, methods such as functional MRI should be used with extreme caution, as they entail significant risks to the patient. Owing to its non-invasive nature and high spatial and temporal resolution, magnetoencepholography (MEG) is currently one of the most promising techniques for elucidating the neural mechanisms affected by DBS.On balance, the evidence so far suggests that the most likely mode of action for DBS is through stimulation-induced modulation of brain activity, where the modulation comes about through the local effects of the DBS electrode on the neural activity in the DBS target, which is passed on to mono- and poly-synaptic network connections.Future applications of DBS include finding more effective brain targets and delivering individualized closed-loop demand-driven stimulation. It will also be important to develop robust translational models of affective disorders. Overall, combining DBS with whole-brain neuroimaging methods like MEG has the makings of a powerful and sophisticated tool for unravelling the fundamental mechanisms of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

However, temporal lobe seizures tend to arise from discrete regions before overt clinical behaviour, making temporally and spatially specific treatment theoretically possible. Here we report the arrest of spontaneous seizures using a real-time, closed-loop, response system and in vivo optogenetics in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Either optogenetic inhibition of excitatory principal cells, or activation of a subpopulation of GABAergic cells representing {$<$}5\% of hippocampal neurons, stops seizures rapidly upon light application. These results demonstrate that spontaneous temporal lobe seizures can be detected and terminated by modulating specific cell populations in a spatially restricted manner. A clinical approach built on these principles may overcome many of the side-effects of currently available treatment options.},

A role for theta oscillations in spatial navigation is supported by half a century of research reporting that theta frequency encodes running speed linearly so that displacement can be estimated through theta frequency integration. We show that this relationship is an artifact caused by the fact that the speed of freely moving animals could not be systematically disentangled from acceleration. Using an experimental procedure that clamps running speed at pre-set values, we find that the theta frequency of local field potentials and spike activity is linearly related to positive acceleration, but not negative acceleration or speed. The modulation by positive-only acceleration makes rhythmic activity at theta frequency unfit as a code to compute displacement or any other kinematic variable. Temporally precise variations in theta frequency may instead serve as a mechanism for speeding up entorhinal-hippocampal computations during accelerated movement.},

Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured.Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.These data indicate that N-methyl-Daspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.},

Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is emerging as a neuromodulation approach that combines noninvasiveness with focus that can be relatively sharp even in regions deep in the brain. This may enable studies of the causal role of specific brain regions in specific behaviors and behavioral disorders. In addition to causal brain mapping, the spatial focus of FUS opens new avenues for treatments of neurological and psychiatric conditions.

  abstract = {Focused ultrasound has been shown to stimulate excitable cells, but the biophysical mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain poorly understood. To provide additional insight, we devised a behavioral-genetic assay applied to the well-characterized nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. We found that pulsed ultrasound elicits robust reversal behavior in wild-type animals in a pressure-, duration-, and pulse protocol-dependent manner. Responses were preserved in mutants unable to sense thermal fluctuations and absent in mutants lacking neurons required for mechanosensation. Additionally, we found that the worm's response to ultrasound pulses rests on the expression of MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC/ASIC ion channel required for touch sensation. Consistent with prior studies of MEC-4-dependent currents in vivo, the worm's response was optimal for pulses repeated 300\textendash 1000 times per second. Based on these findings, we conclude that mechanical, rather than thermal, stimulation accounts for behavioral responses. Further, we propose that acoustic radiation force governs the response to ultrasound in a manner that depends on the touch receptor neurons and MEC-4-dependent ion channels. Our findings illuminate a complete pathway of ultrasound action, from the forces generated by propagating ultrasound to an activation of a specific ion channel. The findings further highlight the importance of optimizing ultrasound pulsing protocols when stimulating neurons via ion channels with mechanosensitive properties. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How ultrasound influences neurons and other excitable cells has remained a mystery for decades. Although it is widely understood that ultrasound can heat tissues and induce mechanical strain, whether or not neuronal activation depends on heat, mechanical force, or both physical factors is not known. We harnessed Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes and their extraordinary sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli to address this question. Whereas thermosensory mutants respond to ultrasound similar to wild-type animals, mechanosensory mutants were insensitive to ultrasound stimulation. Additionally, stimulus parameters that accentuate mechanical effects were more effective than those producing more heat. These findings highlight a mechanical nature of the effect of ultrasound on neurons and suggest specific ways to optimize stimulation protocols in specific tissues.},

  abstract = {Transcranial focused ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to stimulate neurons in animals and humans, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. It has been hypothesized that US, a mechanical stimulus, may mediate cellular discharge by activating mechanosensitive ion channels embedded within cellular membranes. To test this hypothesis, we expressed potassium and sodium mechanosensitive ion channels (channels of the two-pore-domain potassium family (K2P) including TREK-1, TREK-2, TRAAK; NaV1.5) in the Xenopus oocyte system. Focused US (10\,MHz, 0.3\textendash 4.9\,W/cm2) modulated the currents flowing through the ion channels on average by up to 23\%, depending on channel and stimulus intensity. The effects were reversible upon repeated stimulation and were abolished when a channel blocker (ranolazine to block NaV1.5, BaCl2 to block K2P channels) was applied to the solution. These data reveal at the single cell level that focused US modulates the activity of specific ion channels to mediate transmembrane currents. These findings open doors to investigations of the effects of US on ion channels expressed in neurons, retinal cells, or cardiac cells, which may lead to important medical applications. The findings may also pave the way to the development of sonogenetics: a non-invasive, US-based analogue of optogenetics.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a common disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. An overwhelming majority of people with epilepsy regard the unpredictability of seizures as a major issue. More than 30 years of international effort have been devoted to the prediction of seizures, aiming to remove the burden of unpredictability and to couple novel, time-specific treatment to seizure prediction technology. A highly influential review published in 2007 concluded that insufficient evidence indicated that seizures could be predicted. Since then, several advances have been made, including successful prospective seizure prediction using intracranial EEG in a small number of people in a trial of a real-time seizure prediction device. In this Review, we examine advances in the field, including EEG databases, seizure prediction competitions, the prospective trial mentioned and advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of seizures. We argue that these advances, together with statistical evaluations, set the stage for a resurgence in efforts towards the development of seizure prediction methodologies. We propose new avenues of investigation involving a synergy between mechanisms, models, data, devices and algorithms and refine the existing guidelines for the development of seizure prediction technology to instigate development of a solution that removes the burden of the unpredictability of seizures.},

It was demonstrated that the compound has potent antidepressant action. Best responses were obtained in cases of endogenous depression showing the typical symptoms of mental and motor retardation, fatigue, feeling of heaviness, hopelessness, guilt, and despair. The condition is furthermore characterized by the aggravation of symptoms in the morning with a tendency to improvement during the day. Treatment with imipramine hydrochloride resulted in full or social recovery in a high percentage of the patients. As a rule, the initial response was evident within 2 to 3 days, while in some cases 1 to 4 weeks of therapy were required. In view of the symptomatic nature of the action of imipramine hydrochloride, therapy must be maintained as long as the illness lasts. The side effects noted were relatively slight, and with the exception of one case of severe allergic exanthema necessitating discontinuance of treatment, no serious complications were encountered. In some cases of depression, particularly those associated with organic brain damage or schizophrenic psychosis, transitory states of agitation or exacerbation of the psychotic features were noted. These observations suggest the importance of a proper selection of the patients as to type and etiology of depression. While in a number of instances, neurotic, schizophrenic or other depressions were also benefited by the drug, particularly when used in combination with chlorpromazine, electroshock or psychotherapy, it is concluded that imipramine hydrochloride is primarily indicated and effective in the treatment of endogenous depression.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) shows multiple types of pathological pathway in which cholinergic neuron deficiency is 95 \% popular and the oldest pathological mechanism. However, the effect of tacrine on the hippocampal dependent memory is not yet known. In this study, we did verify that tacrine induced recovery of the specific pattern associated memory along with long-term memory through the improvement in the pattern of neural oscillation from deficits condition in the hippocampus of 6th month old AD mice. Our results showed that tacrine improved the performance of Morris water maze related spatial cognitive functions, and enhanced LTP in AD-TAC mice. Furthermore, our results implied that tacrine strongly improve the patterns of neural oscillations, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the 6th month old APP-PS1 double transgenic AD-TAC mice via changing the theta and alpha power spectra including with the improvement in theta, alpha and gamma synchronization. Moreover, tacrine generated the improvement in the theta cross spectra, theta-gamma phase-phase synchronization and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. Besides, the data represented that tacrine accelerated the expression of NR2B, SYP and GAD65 while it caused deceleration on the expression of GAD67 neurotransmitter and A{$\beta$}. Thus, our results infer that tacrine works as a strong causative agent for improving the specific pattern-associated spatial long-term memory in the AD mice without showing any side effect.},

  abstract = {Innate social behaviours, such as mating and fighting, are fundamental to animal reproduction and survival1. However, social engagements can also put an individual at risk2. Little is known about the neural mechanisms that enable appropriate risk assessment and the suppression of hazardous social interactions. Here we identify the posteromedial nucleus of the cortical amygdala (COApm) as a locus required for the suppression of male mating when a female mouse is unhealthy. Using anatomical tracing, functional imaging and circuit-level epistatic analyses, we show that suppression of mating with an unhealthy female is mediated by the COApm projections onto the glutamatergic population of the medial amygdalar nucleus (MEA). We further show that the role of the COApm-to-MEA connection in regulating male mating behaviour relies on the neuromodulator thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH is expressed in the COApm, whereas the TRH receptor (TRHR) is found in the postsynaptic MEA glutamatergic neurons. Manipulating neural activity of TRH-expressing neurons in the COApm modulated male mating behaviour. In the MEA, activation of the TRHR pathway by ligand infusion inhibited mating even towards healthy female~mice, whereas genetic ablation of TRHR facilitated mating with unhealthy individuals. In summary, we reveal a neural pathway that relies on the neuromodulator TRH to modulate social interactions according to the health status of the reciprocating individual. Individuals must balance the cost of social interactions relative to the benefit, as deficits in the ability to select healthy mates may lead to the spread of disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have pointed out the involvement of the basal forebrain gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated system in mediating the effects of general anesthesia. In this study, the authors asked whether the basal forebrain cholinergic system is also involved in mediating the effects of general anesthetics such as propofol. METHODS: Cholinergic lesions were produced by administration of the selective immunotoxin 192 immunoglobulin G-saporin into the lateral ventricles, the medial septum, or the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. The anesthetic potency of propofol was determined using an anesthetic score with a crossover counterbalanced design. Animals were given intraperitoneal propofol (25 or 50 mg/kg) repeatedly every 15 min to set up a subanesthetic (low-dose) or anesthetic (high-dose) state. The anesthetic score was assessed for each cumulative dose. Control of the cholinergic depletion was performed using histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining on brain slices. RESULTS: A shift from a subanesthetic state to an anesthetic state was observed mainly in the rats with the immunotoxin injected into the lateral ventricles or the medial septum and vertical diagonal band of Broca, compared with controls. In those rats, the density of acetylcholinesterase reaction products was normal in the striatum and the thalamus, but reduced in the cortex and the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The anesthetic potency of propofol was increased in all rats with hippocampal lesions, whatever the injection sites, compared with controls. These results demonstrate that a cholinergic dysfunction in the basal forebrain potentiates the anesthetic effects of propofol.},

  abstract = {Drug-refractory focal epilepsies are network diseases associated with functional connectivity alterations both during ictal and interictal periods. A large majority of studies on the interictal/resting state have focused on functional MRI-based functional connectivity. Few studies have used electrophysiology, despite its high temporal capacities. In particular, stereotactic-EEG is highly suitable to study functional connectivity because it permits direct intracranial electrophysiological recordings with relative large-scale sampling. Most previous studies in stereotactic-EEG have been directed towards temporal lobe epilepsy, which does not represent the whole spectrum of drug-refractory epilepsies. The present study aims at filling this gap, investigating interictal functional connectivity alterations behind cortical epileptic organization and its association with post-surgical prognosis. To this purpose, we studied a large cohort of 59 patients with malformation of cortical development explored by stereotactic-EEG with a wide spatial sampling (76 distinct brain areas were recorded, median of 13.2 per patient). We computed functional connectivity using non-linear correlation. We focused on three zones defined by stereotactic-EEG ictal activity: the epileptogenic zone, the propagation zone and the non-involved zone. First, we compared within-zone and between-zones functional connectivity. Second, we analysed the directionality of functional connectivity between these zones. Third, we measured the associations between functional connectivity measures and clinical variables, especially post-surgical prognosis. Our study confirms that functional connectivity differs according to the zone under investigation. We found: (i) a gradual decrease of the within-zone functional connectivity with higher values for epileptogenic zone and propagation zone, and lower for non-involved zones; (ii) preferential coupling between structures of the epileptogenic zone; (iii) preferential coupling between epileptogenic zone and propagation zone; and (iv) poorer post-surgical outcome in patients with higher functional connectivity of non-involved zone (within- non-involved zone, between non-involved zone and propagation zone functional connectivity). Our work suggests that, even during the interictal state, functional connectivity is reinforced within epileptic cortices (epileptogenic zone and propagation zone) with a gradual organization. Moreover, larger functional connectivity alterations, suggesting more diffuse disease, are associated with poorer post-surgical prognosis. This is consistent with computational studies suggesting that connectivity is crucial in order to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of seizures.10.1093/brain/awy214\_video1awy214media15833456182001},

Lidocaine injections before the test session produced increases in the frequency of entries, time spent and distance run in the open arms without affecting activity occurring in the closed arms. During the retest session, saline- and lidocaine-treated rats exhibited increased indices of anxiety and lidocaine-treated rats exhibited decreased closed-arm entries.

Three main lines of investigation were pursued including: (1) mapping the brain areas whose physiological function was modulated by stimulation using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, (2) assessing whether DBS could correct the regional alterations in cerebral glucose metabolism in AD using positron emission tomography (PET), and 3) measuring the effects of DBS on cognitive function over time using clinical scales and instruments. Results DBS drove neural activity in the memory circuit, including the entorhinal, and hippocampal areas and activated the brain's default mode network. PET scans showed an early and striking reversal of the impaired glucose utilization in the temporal and parietal lobes that was maintained after 12 months of continuous stimulation. Evaluation of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale and the Mini Mental State Examination suggested possible improvements and/or slowing in the rate of cognitive decline at 6 and 12 months in some patients. There were no serious adverse events. Interpretation There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for AD. Modulating pathological brain activity in this illness with DBS merits further investigation. Ann Neurol 2010},

  abstract = {Studies of the neuropharmacological substrates of spatial memory formation have focused on the contribution of septohippocampal pathways. Although these pathways include, among others, cholinergic and GABAergic fibers innervating the hippocampus, research has essentially been oriented towards the role of their cholinergic component. Recently, a few studies investigated the role of GABAergic septohippocampal projections. These only focused on almost immediate or recent memory and yielded discrepant results. GABAergic lesions impaired learning or had no effects. Given the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and the potential modulatory influence of the septum on hippocampal function, it is relevant to study the role of the septohippocampal interface in memory stabilization. We performed investigations with relatively selective lesions of GABAergic (using oxerin-saporin) or/and cholinergic (using 192 IgG-saporin) medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/vDBB) neurons in rats, and assessed acquisition of a spatial memory and its subsequent recall in the water maze. Following a 6-day training phase during which all groups improved performance to comparable levels, retention was tested 1, 5, or 25 days later. At the 1-day delay, all groups performed above chance and did not differ significantly among each other. At the 5-day delay, only rats with GABAergic or combined lesions exhibited a retention deficit. At the 25-day delay, all three lesion groups performed at chance level; in these groups, performance was significantly lower than that found in sham-operated rats. Immunochemical and histochemical verifications of the lesion extent/selectivity showed extensive GABAergic damage after intraseptal orexin-saporin infusions or cholinergic damage after 192 IgG-saporin infusions, with relatively limited damage to the other neurotransmitter system. Our data show that GABAergic and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons both contribute to memory stabilization, and could do so in a sequential way: GABAergic processes could be engaged at an earlier stage than cholinergic ones during system consolidation of a spatial memory. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Using Dlxi12b\textendash Cre mice, we found anatomical evidence for GABAergic neurons that project from the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to multiple subcortical targets. We used a combination of patch-clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, and pharmacology to confirm that Dlxi12b-labeled projections from the mPFC to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) release GABA and do not corelease glutamate. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of these GABAergic projections from mPFC to NAcc induces avoidance behavior in a real-time place preference task, suggesting that these long-range projecting GABAergic neurons can transmit aversive signals. Finally, we found evidence for heterogeneous histochemical and/or electrophysiological properties of long-range projecting GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Some of these neurons were labeled in parvalbumin\textendash Cre and vasoactive intestinal peptide\textendash Cre mice. We also used a novel intersectional targeting strategy to label GABAergic neurons in the mPFC that project to NAcc and found that these neurons have fast-spiking properties and express parvalbumin.

The region may coordinate cortical and subcortical nociceptive responses.         ABSTRACT~         The medial septum is anatomically and functionally linked to the hippocampus, a region implicated in nociception. However, the role of medial septum in nociception remains unclear. To investigate the role of the region in nociception in rats, muscimol, a GABA agonist, or zolpidem, a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, was microinjected into medial septum to attenuate the activity of neurons in the region. Electrophysiological studies in anesthetized rats indicated that muscimol evoked a stronger and longer-lasting suppression of medial septal-mediated activation of hippocampal theta field activity than zolpidem. Similarly, microinjection of muscimol (1 or 2 {$\mu$}g/0.5 {$\mu$}l) into the medial septum of awake rats suppressed both licking and flinching behaviors in the formalin test of inflammatory pain, whereas only the latter behavior was affected by zolpidem (8 or 12 {$\mu$}g/0.5 {$\mu$}l) administered into the medial septum. Interestingly, both drugs selectively attenuated nociceptive behaviors in the second phase of the formalin test that are partly driven by central plasticity. Indeed, muscimol reduced the second phase behaviors by 30\% to 60\%, which was comparable to the reduction seen with systemic administration of a moderate dose of the analgesic morphine. The reduction was accompanied by a decrease in formalin-induced expression of spinal c-Fos protein that serves as an index of spinal nociceptive processing. The drug effects on nociceptive behaviors were without overt sedation and were distinct from the effects observed after septal lateral microinjections. Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of medial septum is pro-nociceptive and facilitates aspects of central neural processing underlying nociception.},

In the present study, we applied stimulatory focused ultrasound transcranially to the primary sensorimotor (SM1) and visual (V1) brain areas in sheep (Dorset, all female, n~=~8), under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging, and examined the electrophysiologic responses. By use of a 250-kHz focused ultrasound transducer, the area was sonicated in pulsed mode (tone-burst duration of 1~ms, duty cycle of 50\%) for 300~ms. The acoustic intensity at the focal target was varied up to a spatial peak pulse-average intensity (Isppa) of 14.3~W/cm2. Sonication of SM1 elicited electromyographic responses from the contralateral hind leg, whereas stimulation of V1 generated electroencephalographic potentials. These responses were detected only above a certain acoustic intensity, and the threshold intensity, as well as the degree of responses, varied among sheep. Post-sonication animal behavior was normal, but minor microhemorrhages were observed from the V1 areas exposed to highly repetitive sonication (every second for {$\geq$}500 times for electroencephalographic measurements, Isppa~=~6.6\textendash 10.5~W/cm2, mechanical index~=~0.9\textendash 1.2).

  abstract = {Temporal interference (TI) stimulation was recently proposed that allows for the stimulation of deep brain structures with neocortical regions being minimally stimulated. For human brain modulation, TI current patterns are known to be considerably affected by the complex structures of the human head, and thus, it is hard to deliver TI current to a specific deep brain region. In this study, we optimized scalp electrode configurations and injection currents that can deliver maximum TI stimulation currents to a specific deep brain region, the head of the right hippocampus in this study, considering the real anatomical head structures of each individual. Three realistic finite element (FE) head models were employed for the optimization of TI stimulation. To generate TI current patterns, two pairs of scalp electrodes were selected, which carry two sinusoidally alternating currents with a small frequency difference. For every possible combination of electrode pairs, optimal injection currents delivering the maximal TI currents to the head of the right hippocampus were determined. The distribution of the optimized TI currents was then compared with that of the unoptimized TI currents and the conventional single frequency alternating current stimulation. Optimization of TI stimulation parameters allows for the delivery of the desired amount of TI current to the target region while effectively reducing the TI currents delivered to cortical regions compared to the other stimulation approaches. Inconsistency of the optimal stimulation conditions suggest that customized stimulation, considering the individual anatomical differences, is necessary for more effective transcranial TI stimulation. Customized transcranial TI stimulation based on the numerical field analysis is expected to enhance the overall effectiveness of noninvasive stimulation of the human deep brain structures.},

Although there have been several studies related to ultrasonic neuromodulation, these studies have suffered from poor spatial resolution of the ultrasound and low repeatability with a fixed condition caused by conventional and commercialized ultrasound transducers. In addition, the underlying physics and mechanisms of ultrasonic neuromodulation are still unknown. To determine these mechanisms and accurately modulate neural circuits, researchers must have a precisely controllable ultrasound transducer to conduct experiments at the cellular level. Herein, we introduce a new MEMS ultrasound stimulation system for modulating neurons or brain slices with high spatial resolution. The piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (pMUTs) with small membranes (sub-mm membranes) generate enough power to stimulate neurons and enable precise modulation of neural circuits. We designed the ultrasound transducer as an array structure to enable localized modulation in the target region. In addition, we integrated a cell culture chamber with the system to make it compatible with conventional cell-based experiments, such as in vitro cell cultures and brain slices. In this work, we successfully demonstrated the functionality of the system by showing that the number of responding cells is proportional to the acoustic intensity of the applied ultrasound. We also demonstrated localized stimulation capability with high spatial resolution by conducting experiments in which cocultured cells responded only around a working transducer.},

Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat neurological disorders related to motor dysfunction, the effectiveness of stimulation to treat cognition remains largely unknown. In this study, adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a lateral fluid percussion or sham injury followed by implantation of bipolar electrodes in the medial septal nucleus (MSN) and ipsilateral hippocampus. In the first week after injury, there was a significant decrease in hippocampal theta oscillations that correlated with decreased object exploration and impaired performance in the Barnes maze spatial learning task. Continuous 7.7\,Hz theta stimulation of the medial septum significantly increased hippocampal theta oscillations, restored normal object exploration, and improved spatial learning in injured animals. There were no benefits with 100\,Hz gamma stimulation, and stimulation of sham animals at either frequency did not enhance performance. We conclude, therefore, that there was a theta frequency-specific benefit of DBS that restored cognitive function in brain-injured rats. These data suggest that septal theta stimulation may be an effective and novel neuromodulatory therapy for treatment of persistent cognitive deficits following TBI.},

Hippocampal theta oscillations are critical in optimizing hippocampal function and facilitating plasticity. We hypothesized that pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus would disrupt oscillations and behavioral performance and that electrical neuromodulation to entrain theta would improve cognition specifically in injured rats. Rats received a pilocarpine (n=30) or saline injection (n=27) and unilateral bi-polar electrodes were implanted into the medial septum and hippocampus the following day. Hippocampal and septal theta were recorded in a Plexiglas box over the first week following implantation. Control and pilocarpine-treated rats were split into stimulation (continuous 7.7Hz, 80{$\mu$}A, 1ms pulse width) and non-stimulation groups for behavioral analysis. Continuous stimulation was initiated one-minute prior to and throughout an object exploration task (post-injury day seven) and again for each of six trials on the Barnes maze (post-injury days 12\textendash 14). There was a significant reduction in hippocampal theta power (p{$<$}0.05) and percentage of time oscillating in theta (p{$<$}0.05). In addition there was a significant decrease in object exploration in rats post-pilocarpine (p{$<$}0.05) and an impairment in spatial learning. Specifically, pilocarpine-treated rats were more likely to use random search strategies (p{$<$}0.001) and had an increase in latency to find the hidden platform (p{$<$}0.05) on the Barnes maze. Stimulation of the medial septum at 7.7Hz in pilocarpine-treated rats resulted in performance similar to shams in both the object recognition and Barnes maze tasks. Stimulation of sham rats resulted in impaired object exploration (p{$<$}0.05) with no difference in Barnes maze latency or strategy. In conclusion, pilocarpine-induced seizures diminished hippocampal oscillations and impaired performance in both an object exploration and a spatial memory task in pilocarpine-treated rats. Theta stimulation at 7.7Hz improved behavioral outcome on the Barnes maze task; this improvement in function was not related to a general cognitive enhancement, as shams did not benefit from stimulation. Therefore, stimulation of the medial septum represents an exciting target to improve behavioral outcome in patients with epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Transcranial focused ultrasound is an emerging form of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses acoustic energy to affect neuronal excitability. The effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability and behavior is currently unknown. We apply ultrasound to the primary motor cortex in humans using a novel simultaneous transcranial ultrasound and magnetic stimulation paradigm that allows for concurrent and concentric ultrasound stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This allows for non-invasive inspection of the effect of ultrasound on motor neuronal excitability using the motor evoked potential (MEP). We test the effect of ultrasound on single pulse MEP recruitment curves and paired pulse protocols including short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). In addition, we test the effect of ultrasound to motor cortex on a stimulus response reaction time task. Results show ultrasound inhibits the amplitude of single-pulse MEPs and attenuates intracortical facilitation but does not affect intracortical inhibition. Ultrasound also reduces reaction time on a simple stimulus response task. This is the first report of the effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability and motor behavior and confirms previous results in the somatosensory cortex that ultrasound results in effective neuronal inhibition that confers a performance advantage.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a promising therapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Particularly, the stimulation of the forniceal area was found to slow down the cognitive decline of some AD patients, but the biochemical and anatomical modifications underlying these effects remain poorly understood. We evaluated the effects of chronic forniceal stimulation on amyloid burden, inflammation, and neuronal loss in a transgenic Alzheimer rat model TgF344-AD, as well as in age-matched control rats. 18-month-old rats were surgically implanted with electrodes in stereotactic conditions and connected to a portable microstimulator for chronic DBS in freely moving rats. The stimulation was continuous during 5 weeks and animals were immediately sacrificed for immunohistochemical analysis of pathological markers. Implanted, but non-stimulated rats were used as controls. We found that chronic forniceal DBS in the Tg-AD rat significantly reduces amyloid deposition in the hippocampus and cortex, decreases astrogliosis and microglial activation and lowers neuronal loss, as determined by NeuN staining. In control animals, the stimulation neither affects neuroinflammation nor neuronal count. In the Tg-F344-AD rat model, 5 weeks of forniceal DBS decreased amyloidosis, inflammatory responses, and neuronal loss in both cortex and hippocampus. These findings strongly suggest a neuroprotective effect of DBS and support the beneficial effects of targeting the fornix in Alzheimer's disease patients.},

In the present study we reexamined the intraseptal connectivity with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin tracing combined with choline acetyltransferase and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry at both the light and electron microscopic levels. We found that the previously hypothesized lateral septum to medial septum projection is extremely sparse and that the major medial septum to lateral septum path is parvalbumin-immunoreactive (likely GABAergic).

  abstract = {Activation of median raphe serotonergic neurons results in the desynchronization of hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. This could be a direct effect, because serotonin (5-HT) fibers terminate on a specific population of hippocampal interneurons. On the other hand, it could be an indirect action through the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) pacemaker cells, because, in addition to previously described inhibitory effects, excitatory actions of 5-HT have been demonstrated on MSDB {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons through 5-HT2A receptors. Electron microscopic double immunostaining for Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) injected into the median raphe (MR) and parvalbumin, choline acetyltransferase, or calretinin as well as double immunostaining for 5-HT and parvalbumin, and colocalization for parvalbumin and 5-HT2A receptors were done in rats. The results demonstrated that: 1) MR axons form perisomatic and peridendritic baskets and asymmetric synaptic contacts on MSDB parvalbumin neurons; 2) these fibers do not terminate on septal cholinergic and calretinin neurons; 3) 5-HT fibers form synapses identical to those formed by PHA-L-immunolabeled axons with parvalbumin neurons; and 4) MSDB parvalbumin cells contain 5-HT2A receptors. These observations indicate that 5-HT has a dual action on the activity of hippocampal principal cells: 1) an inhibition of the input sector by activation of hippocampal GABA neurons that terminate exclusively on apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and 2) a disinhibition of the output sector of principal neurons. MSDB parvalbumin-containing GABAergic neurons specifically innervate hippocampal basket and chandelier cells. Thus, 5-HT-elicited activation of MSDB GABAergic neurons will result in a powerful inhibition of these GABA neurons. J. Comp.

  abstract = {This study deals with two characteristic cell types in the rat septal complex, In this study the term ``spetal complex'' comprises the MSDB (medial septal nucleus and vertical limb of the nucleus of the diagonal band) and the lateral septum (LS) (lateral and dorsal septal nuclei). i.e., cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, and their synaptic connections. Cholinergic elements were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme. Antiserum against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the GABA synthesizing enzyme, was employed to identify GABAergic perikarya and terminals, by using either the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique or a biotinylated second antiserum and avidinated gold or ferritin. With these contrasting immunolabels we have studied the cholinergic-GABAergic interconnections in double-labeled sections of intact septal regions and the GABAergic innervation of medial septal area cholinergic neurons in sections taken from animals 1 week following lateral septal area lesion. In other electron microscopic experiments we have studied cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the septal complex for synaptic contacts with hippocamposeptal fibers, which were identified by anterograde degeneration following fimbria-fornix transection. Our results are summarized as follows: (1) GAD-positive terminals form synaptic contacts on ChAT-immunoreactive dendrites in the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MSDB), (2) surgical lesion of the lateral septal area resulted in a dramatic decrease of the number of GABAergic boutons on MSDB cholinergic neurons, (3) cholinergic terminals establish synaptic contacts with GAD immunoreactive cell bodies and proximal dendrites in the MSDB as well as in the lateral septum (LS), (4) degenerated terminals of hippocampo-septal fibers were mainly observed in the LS, where they formed asymmetric synaptic contacts on dendrites of GABAergic neurons and on nonimmunoreactive spines. We did not observe degenerated boutons in contact with ChAT-positive dendrites or cell bodies in the MSDB. From these results and from data in the literature we conclude that excitatory hippocampo-septal fibers activate GABAergic cells, and as yet unidentified spiny neurons in the LS, which may control the discharge of medial septal cholinergic neurons known to project back to the hippocampal formation.},

The extrinsic and intrinsic CR innervation of the same brain areas were elucidated on control rats and on animals in which the septum was surgically separated from its ventral afferents. Correlated light and electron microscopic double-immunostaining experiments were used to determine the synaptic connections between CR axon terminals and lateral septal area calbindin (CB)- and medial septal area choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons. Furthermore, to determine the synaptic power of supramammilloseptal aspartate/glutamatergic neurons on the septal complex, semiquantitative analyses were performed in the supramammillary area on retrogradely (1) [3H]-d-aspartate-radiolabeled and (2) HRP-labeled material. The results demonstrated that a population of the extrinsic CR axons originating in the supramammillary area are aspartate/glutamatergic. These fibers forming asymmetric synaptic contacts terminate on both CB and cholinergic neurons. Intraseptal CR neurons, which establish symmetric synapses, innervate only lateral septal area neurons, including the CB-containing cells.

Septal lesioned rats required a longer time to recover from a loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a loss of tail-pinch response after injectable (20mg/kg i.p. pentobarbital, 5mg/kg i.v. propofol) or volatile (1.5\% halothane, 2\% isoflurane) anesthetic. When incremental doses of propofol were given i.p., septal lesioned rats as compared to control rats showed LORR at a lower dose of propofol. Similarly, when the rats were exposed to increasing concentrations of isoflurane, the percent of rats showing LORR was leftward shifted for lesioned rats as compared to control rats. Septal lesioned rats as compared to control rats showed decreased locomotor activity when exposed to 1.5\% halothane. Lesion of the medial septum was confirmed by thionin-stained histological sections as well as loss of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) staining in the hippocampus, indicating a depletion of septohippocampal cholinergic afferents. Medial septal lesion resulted in a near complete loss of hippocampal theta rhythm during walking and a general decrease in power of the hippocampal EEG at all frequencies (0\textendash 100Hz), during walking or immobility. It is concluded that lesion of medial septum, in part through a loss of septohippocampal cholinergic afferents, increased the anesthesia response to volatile and injectable general anesthetics, during both induction and emergence. It is suggested that the septohippocampal system participates in many components of general anesthesia including hypnosis, immobility, and analgesia.},

The NMDA receptor antagonist-induced model of schizophrenia is characterized by behavioral and electrophysiological disruptions, including a decrease in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI), hyperlocomotion, decrease in gating of hippocampal auditory evoked potentials and robust increase in hippocampal gamma (30\textendash 100Hz) oscillations. Similar disruptions were also induced by a single electrographic seizure in the hippocampus. The behavioral and electrophysiological disruptions induced by an NMDA receptor antagonist can be reduced by inactivation or lesion of GABAergic neurons in the medial septum, deep brain stimulation of the medial septum or nucleus accumbens, or positive modulation of GABAB receptors. Our results suggest a close association between high-amplitude hippocampal gamma oscillations and psychosis-relevant behaviors including PPI loss, behavioral hyperactivity and loss in auditory gating. Abnormal electrophysiology suggests a disruption of somatic and apical dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus, resulting in distorted sensory integration, and impaired cognitive and memory processing. The hippocampus is suggested to be a hub in a brain network that participates in psychosis-relevant behaviors, through its direct projection to the nucleus accumbens, or through indirect connections via the entorhinal, cingulate and prefrontal cortices.},

  abstract = {Episodic memory is the ability to accurately remember events from our past. The process of pattern separation is hypothesized to underpin this ability and is defined as the ability to orthogonalize memory traces, to maximize the features that make them unique. Contemporary cognitive neuroscience suggests that pattern separation entails complex interactions between the hippocampus and the neocortex, where specific hippocampal subregions shape neural reinstatement in the neocortex. To test this hypothesis, the current work studied both healthy controls and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who present with hippocampal structural anomalies. In all participants, we measured neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they retrieved memorized items compared to lure items which share features with the target. Behaviorally, TLE patients were less able to exclude lures than controls, and showed a reduction in pattern separation. To assess the hypothesized relationship between neural patterns in the hippocampus and the neocortex, we identified topographic gradients of intrinsic connectivity along neocortical and hippocampal subfield surfaces and identified the topographic profile of the neural activity accompanying pattern separation. In healthy controls, pattern separation followed a graded pattern of neural activity, both along the hippocampal long axis (and peaked in anterior segments that are more heavily engaged in transmodal processing) and along the neocortical hierarchy running from unimodal to transmodal regions (peaking in transmodal default mode regions). In TLE patients, however, this concordance between task-based functional activations and topographic gradients was markedly reduced. Furthermore, person specific measures of concordance between task-related activity and connectivity gradients in patients and controls related to inter-individual differences in behavioral measures of pattern separation and episodic memory, highlighting the functional relevance of the observed topographic motifs. Our work is consistent with an emerging understanding that successful discrimination between memories with similar features entails a shift in the locus of neural activity away from sensory systems, a pattern that is mirrored along the hippocampal long axis and with respect to neocortical hierarchies. More broadly, our study establishes topographic profiling using intrinsic connectivity gradients captures the functional underpinnings of episodic memory processes in manner that is sensitive to their reorganization in pathology.},

However, the distributed nature of neural coding can lead to interference between sensory and memory representations. Here, we show that the brain mitigates such interference by rotating sensory representations into orthogonal memory representations over time. To study how sensory inputs and memories are represented, we recorded neurons from the auditory cortex of mice as they implicitly learned sequences of sounds. We found that the neural population represented sensory inputs and the memory of recent stimuli in two orthogonal dimensions. The transformation of sensory information into a memory was facilitated by a combination of `stable' neurons, which maintained their selectivity over time, and `switching' neurons, which inverted their selectivity over time. Together, these neural responses rotated the population representation, transforming sensory inputs into memory. Theoretical modeling showed that this rotational dynamic is an efficient mechanism for generating orthogonal representations, thereby protecting memories from sensory interference.},

Methods A comprehensive search of the medical literature (PubMed, Medline) was conducted to identify relevant articles investigating DBS therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Reference lists of these articles were used to source further articles. Results Stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) and hippocampus (HC) has been shown to decrease the frequency of refractory seizures. Half of all patients from clinical studies experienced a 46\%-90\% seizure reduction with ANT-DBS, and a 48\%-95\% seizure reduction with HC-DBS. The efficacy of stimulating other targets remains inconclusive due to lack of evidence. Approximately three-fourths of patients receiving ANT, HC, or centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (CMT) stimulation are responders\textemdash experiencing a seizure reduction of at least 50\%. The time course of clinical benefit varies dramatically, with both an initial lesional effect and ongoing stimulation effect at play. Improved quality of life and changes to cognition or mood may also occur. Side effects are similar in nature to those reported from DBS therapy for movement disorders. Several factors are potentially associated with stimulation efficacy, including an absence of structural abnormality on imaging for ANT and HC stimulation, and electrode position relative to the target. Certain seizure types or syndromes may respond more favorably to specific targets, including ANT stimulation for deep temporal or limbic seizures, and CMT stimulation for generalized seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Significance We have identified several patient, disease, and stimulation factors that potentially predict seizure outcome following DBS. More large-scale clinical trials are needed to explore different stimulation parameters, reevaluate the indications for DBS, and identify robust predictors of patient response.},

We found that MRN application of the GABAA agonist muscimol (0.05\textendash 1.0 mM) or GABAB agonist baclofen (0.2 mM) by reverse microdialysis had strong theta promoting effects. The GABAA antagonist bicuculline infused in low concentrations (0.1, 0.2 mM) eliminated theta rhythm. A short period of theta activity of higher than normal frequency preceded hippocampal desynchronization in 46\% of rats. Bicuculline in larger concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mM) resulted in a biphasic response of an initial short ({$<$}10 min) hippocampal desynchronization followed by stable theta rhythm that lasted as long as the infusion continued. The frequency and amplitude of theta waves were higher than in control recordings and the oscillations showed a conspicuous intermittent character. Hippocampal theta rhythm elicited by MRN administration of bicuculline could be completely (0.5 mM bicuculline) or partially (1.0 mM bicuculline) blocked by simultaneous infusion of the GABAB antagonist  CGP35348. Our findings suggest that the GABAergic network may have two opposing functions in the MRN: relieving the theta-generators from serotonergic inhibition and regulating the activity of a theta-promoting circuitry by the fluctuating GABA tone. The two mechanisms may be involved in different functions.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulation is an important method for investigating neural circuits and treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. Multiple-target neuromodulation is considered an advanced technology for the flexible optimization of modulation effects. However, traditional methods such as electrical and magnetic stimulations are not convenient for multiple-target applications due to their disadvantages of invasiveness or poor spatial resolution. Ultrasonic neuromodulation is a new noninvasive method that has gained wide attention in the field of neuroscience, and it is potentially able to support multiple-target stimulation by allocating multiple focal points in the brain using an array transducer. However, there are no reports in the literature of the efficacy of this technical concept, and an imaging tool for localizing the stimulation area for evaluating the neural effects in vivo has been lacking. In this study, we designed and fabricated a new system specifically for imaging-guided dual-target neuromodulation. The design of the array transducer and overall system is described in detail. The stimulation points were selectable on a B-mode image. In vivo experiments were carried out in mice, in which forelimbs shaking responses and electromyography outcomes were induced by changing the stimulation targets. The system could be a valuable tool for imaging-guided multiple-target stimulation in various neuroscience applications.},

In this Review, we~critically discuss the evidence on the long-term outcomes of DBS and consider the clinical implications. Although many patients are lost to follow-up, the evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves motor function for up to 10 years, although the magnitude of~improvement tends to decline over time. Functional scores recorded during on-medication periods worsen more quickly than those recorded in off periods, consistent with the degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways. Dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and activities of~daily living in off periods remain improved at 5 years, but quality-of-life scores have usually fallen below preoperative levels. The incidence and severity of dementia among patients receiving DBS are comparable to those among patients who receive medical treatment. Severe~adverse events are rare, but adverse events such as dysarthria are common and probably under-reported. Long-term data on the outcomes of globus pallidus interna DBS are limited and mostly confirm the efficacy for dyskinesia. A trend towards offering DBS in the earlier stages of PD creates a need to identify factors that predict long-term outcomes and to discuss realistic expectations with patients preoperatively.},

We found that bilateral injections of a small amount of muscimol (0.1\textendash 1.0 {$\mu$}g/0.5 {$\mu$}l) in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamus and rostral mesencephalic tegmentum resulted in increased vigilance and insomnia. In contrast, microinjections of muscimol in the middle and anterior parts of the posterior hypothalamus induced long-lasting behavioral and electroencephalographic signs of sleep with short latency. The hypersomnia was characterized by a significant increase in both light and deep slow wave sleep (SWS), and a nearly complete suppression of paradoxical sleep (PS). Animals with muscimol microinjections in the ventrolateral part of the posterior hypothalamus, however, exhibited increased SWS followed by a significant increase in PS. When injected into the posterior hypothalamus of insomniac cats pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), muscimol induced not only SWS but also PS with short latency. The present data thus support the hypotheses that the posterior hypothalamus plays a critical role in the mechanisms of W and that sleep might result from functional blockade of the hypothalamic waking center.},

The evaluation process often depends on the accumulation of evidence from multiple sources, which may arrive at different times. How evidence is accumulated for value computation in the brain during decision making has not been well studied. To address this problem, we trained rhesus monkeys to perform a decision-making task in which they had to make eye movement choices between two targets, whose reward probabilities had to be determined with the combined evidence from four sequentially presented visual stimuli. We studied the encoding of the reward probabilities associated with the stimuli and the eye movements in the orbitofrontal (OFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices during the decision process. We found that the OFC neurons encoded the reward probability associated with individual pieces of evidence in the stimulus domain. Importantly, the representation of the reward probability in the OFC was transient, and the OFC did not encode the reward probability associated with the combined evidence from multiple stimuli. The computation of the combined reward probabilities was observed only in the DLPFC and only in the action domain. Furthermore, the reward probability encoding in the DLPFC exhibited an asymmetric pattern of mixed selectivity that supported the computation of the stimulus-to-action transition of reward information. Our results reveal that the OFC and the DLPFC play distinct roles in the value computation during evidence accumulation.},

Ultrasound stimulation has become a promising approach for noninvasively inducing neuromodulation in animals and humans. However, the previous investigations were subject to substantial limitations, due to most of them involving anesthetized and fixed small-animal models. Studies of awake and freely moving animals are needed, but the currently used ultrasound devices are too bulky to be applied to a freely moving animal. This study is the first time to design and fabricate a miniature and lightweight head-mounted ultrasound stimulator for inducing neuromodulation in freely moving mice. The main components of the stimulator include a miniature piezoelectric ceramic, a concave epoxy acoustic lens, and housing and connection components. The device was able to induce action potentials recorded in situ and evoke head-turning behaviors by stimulating the primary somatosensory cortex barrel field of the mouse. These findings indicate that the proposed method can be used to induce noninvasive neuromodulation in freely moving mice. This novel method could potentially lead to the application of ultrasonic neuromodulation in more-extensive neuroscience investigations.},

Here, we provide proof-of-principle of this approach by using a BCI to interpret pathological brain activity in patients with advanced Parkinson disease (PD) and to use this feedback to control when therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is delivered. Our goal was to demonstrate that by personalizing and optimizing stimulation in real time, we could improve on both the efficacy and efficiency of conventional continuous DBS. Methods We tested BCI-controlled adaptive DBS (aDBS) of the subthalamic nucleus in 8 PD patients. Feedback was provided by processing of the local field potentials recorded directly from the stimulation electrodes. The results were compared to no stimulation, conventional continuous stimulation (cDBS), and random intermittent stimulation. Both unblinded and blinded clinical assessments of motor effect were performed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Results Motor scores improved by 66\% (unblinded) and 50\% (blinded) during aDBS, which were 29\% (p = 0.03) and 27\% (p = 0.005) better than cDBS, respectively. These improvements were achieved with a 56\% reduction in stimulation time compared to cDBS, and a corresponding reduction in energy requirements (p {$<$} 0.001). aDBS was also more effective than no stimulation and random intermittent stimulation.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Various neuromodulation approaches have been employed to alter neuronal spiking activity and thus regulate brain functions and alleviate neurological disorders. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) could be a potential approach for neuromodulation because it requires no tissue contact and possesses a high spatial resolution. However, the risk of overheating and an unclear mechanism hamper its application. Here we show that midinfrared stimulation (MIRS) with a specific wavelength exerts nonthermal, long-distance, and reversible modulatory effects on ion channel activity, neuronal signaling, and sensorimotor behavior. Patch-clamp recording from mouse neocortical pyramidal cells revealed that MIRS readily provides gain control over spiking activities, inhibiting spiking responses to weak inputs but enhancing those to strong inputs. MIRS also shortens action potential (AP) waveforms by accelerating its repolarization, through an increase in voltage-gated K\textsuperscript{+} (but not Na\textsuperscript{+}) currents. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed that MIRS-induced resonance vibration of \textendash C=O bonds at the K\textsuperscript{+} channel ion selectivity filter contributes to the K\textsuperscript{+} current increase. Importantly, these effects are readily reversible and independent of temperature increase. At the behavioral level in larval zebrafish, MIRS modulates startle responses by sharply increasing the slope of the sensorimotor input\textendash output curve. Therefore, MIRS represents a promising neuromodulation approach suitable for clinical application.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) and the K-Cl cotransporter isoform 2 (KCC2), two main members of the cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), have been implicated in human epilepsy via resetting [Cl-]i by accumulating and extruding Cl-, respectively.

Although increasing evidence focusing on the expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 has suggested that impaired chloride plasticity may be closely related to epilepsy, neuroelectrophysiological evidences associated with the functions of NKCC1 and KCC2 are more significantly needed to study the mechanism of epileptogenesis. In this review, we aim to build a bridge between expression and function of NKCC1 and KCC2.

  abstract = {Appetitive-searching (reward-seeking) and distress-avoiding (misery-fleeing) behavior are essential for all free moving animals to stay alive and to have offspring. Therefore, even the oldest ocean-dwelling animal creatures, living about 560 million years ago and human ancestors, must have been capable of generating these behaviors. The current article describes the evolution of the forebrain with special reference to the development of the misery-fleeing system. Although the earliest vertebrate ancestor already possessed a dorsal pallium, which corresponds to the human neocortex, the structure and function of the neocortex was acquired quite recently within the mammalian evolutionary line. Up to, and including, amphibians, the dorsal pallium can be considered to be an extension of the medial pallium, which later develops into the hippocampus. The ventral and lateral pallium largely go up into the corticoid part of the amygdala. The striatopallidum of these early vertebrates becomes extended amygdala, consisting of centromedial amygdala (striatum) connected with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pallidum). This amygdaloid system gives output to hypothalamus and brainstem, but also a connection with the cerebral cortex exists, which in part was created after the development of the more recent cerebral neocortex. Apart from bidirectional connectivity with the hippocampal complex, this route can also be considered to be an output channel as the fornix connects the hippocampus with the medial septum, which is the most important input structure of the medial habenula. The medial habenula regulates the activity of midbrain structures adjusting the intensity of the misery-fleeing response. Within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis the human homologue of the ancient lateral habenula-projecting globus pallidus may exist; this structure is important for the evaluation of efficacy of the reward-seeking response. The described organization offers a framework for the regulation of the stress response, including the medial habenula and the subgenual cingulate cortex, in which dysfunction may explain the major symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders.},

However, the neural circuits for coordinately controlling these important processes remain to be fully dissected. Here we show that the activity of the neuromedin B (NMB) neurons in the nucleus incertus (NI) is tightly correlated with mouse locomotor speed, arousal level, and hippocampal theta power. These processes are reversibly suppressed by optogenetic inhibition and rapidly promoted by optogenetic stimulation of NI NMB neurons. These neurons form reciprocal connections with several subcortical areas associated with arousal, theta oscillation, and premotor processing. Their projections to multiple downstream stations regulate locomotion and hippocampal theta, with the projection to the medial septum being particularly important for promoting arousal. Therefore, NI NMB neurons functionally impact the neural circuit for navigation control according to particular brains states.},

We found that most types projected to multiple targets, and most targets received projections from multiple types, except PFC\textrightarrow PAG (periaqueductal gray). By comparing Ca2+ activity of the molecularly homogeneous PFC\textrightarrow PAG type against two heterogeneous classes in several two-alternative choice tasks in freely moving mice, we found that all task-related signals assayed were qualitatively present in all examined classes. However, PAG-projecting neurons most potently encoded choice in cued tasks, whereas contralateral PFC-projecting neurons most potently encoded reward context in an uncued task. Thus, task signals are organized redundantly, but with clear quantitative biases across cells of specific molecular-anatomical characteristics.},

In previous studies, we showed that inactivation of the medial septum or nucleus accumbens normalized the hyperactive and psychosis-related behaviors induced by psychoactive drugs. We hypothesized that DBS of the medial septum or nucleus accumbens normalizes the ketamine-induced abnormal behaviors and brain activity in freely moving rats. Male Long-Evans rats were subcutaneously injected with ketamine (3mg/kg) alone, or given ketamine and DBS, or injected with saline alone. Subcutaneous injection of ketamine resulted in loss of gating of hippocampal auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), deficit in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and hyperlocomotion, accompanied by increased hippocampal gamma oscillations of 70\textendash 100Hz. Continuous 130-Hz stimulation of the nucleus accumbens, or 100-Hz burst stimulation of the medial septum (1s on and 5s off) significantly attenuated ketamine-induced PPI deficit and hyperlocomotion. Medial septal stimulation also prevented the loss of gating of hippocampal AEPs and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by ketamine. Neither septal or accumbens DBS alone without ketamine injection affected spontaneous locomotion or PPI. The results suggest that DBS of the medial septum or nucleus accumbens may be an effective method to alleviate psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. The effect of medial septal DBS in suppressing both hippocampal gamma oscillations and abnormal behaviors induced by ketamine suggests that hippocampal gamma oscillations are a correlate of disrupted behaviors.},

We have recently discovered, in aged rodents and non-human primates, a pronounced decline in reelin-positive interneurons and concomitant accumulation of reelin in extracellular amyloid-like deposits, both being associated with episodic-like memory impairments. Here, we report that these age-related neuropathological changes in hippocampus, entorhinal and piriform cortices of aged wild-type mice are accompanied by abnormal axonal varicosities and altered expression profiles of calcium-binding proteins in plaque-dense areas, as well as a significant reduction in the number of parvalbumin-positive {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projection neurons in basal forebrain areas, including medial septum (MS), ventral and horizontal diagonal Band of Broca (VDB/HDB) and substantia innominata (SI), compared with young subjects. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cholinergic projection neurons was evident in the HDB/SI area but not in the MS of aged compared with young wild-type mice. No reelin-deposits were found in these basal forebrain regions. Our findings suggest that the elevated reelin plaque load in the projection areas of afferent subcortical GABAergic and cholinergic neurons including hippocampus, entorhinal and piriform cortices affects the axonal integrity and survival of these neurons, potentially contributing to the cognitive impairments observed in aged wild-type mice.},

This refractory form of the disease is associated with high comorbidity rates and increased mortality, and represents an enormous burden to society ({$\sim\$$}10 billion per year).1 In the vast majority of cases, it is characterized by recurrent seizures that arise in a single brain region (the epileptic focus) and can then spread and generalize to the entire brain. The most common form originates in the temporal lobe and accounts for {$\sim$}70\% of patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.2 Indeed, the only effective solution for patients with refractory epilepsy is the resection of the epileptic focus, and even this is only possible in a minority of cases. Rates of drug resistance have not changed in three decades, despite the introduction of more than 15 new anti-seizure drugs,3 and it is therefore imperative that more effective treatments are identified. To this end, several alternative approaches are being developed, including the ketogenic diet, gene therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). In this issue of Brain, Takeuchi and co-workers4 explore whether DBS of the medial septum can stop seizures in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).},

This socioemotional network is organized by theta oscillations leading from prelimbic cortex and amygdala that converge on ventral tegmental area, and network activity is synchronized with brain-wide cellular firing. The network generalizes, on a mouse-by-mouse basis, to encode socioemotional behaviors in healthy animals, but fails to encode an appetitive socioemotional state in a `high confidence' genetic mouse model of autism.

  abstract = {Background In patients with psychotic disorders, sleep spindles are reduced, supporting the hypothesis that the thalamus and glutamate receptors play a crucial etio-pathophysiological role, whose underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved in the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods An electrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to investigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single psychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the sensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results Under the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency: 10\textendash 16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1\textendash 4~Hz) oscillations were recorded in the frontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual juxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and glutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN cells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials (7 to 15 APs at 200\textendash 700~Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine fleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing gamma-(30\textendash 80~Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing pattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode. Furthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC connectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine effects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations. Conclusion The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor hypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta oscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN activities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating system and the corticothalamic pathway.},

Understanding the functional roles of defined neuronal projection pathways in cognitive and behavioral processes requires temporally precise manipulation of their activity \emph{in vivo}. However, existing optogenetic tools have low efficacy and off-target effects when applied to presynaptic terminals, while chemogenetic tools are difficult to control in space and time. Here, we show that a targeting-enhanced mosquito homologue of the vertebrate encephalopsin (eOPN3) can effectively suppress synaptic transmission through the G\textsubscript{i/o} signaling pathway. Brief illumination of presynaptic terminals expressing eOPN3 triggers a lasting suppression of synaptic output that recovers spontaneously within minutes \emph{in vitro} as well as \emph{in vivo}. In freely moving mice, eOPN3-mediated suppression of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents leads to an ipsiversive rotational bias. We conclude that eOPN3 can be used to selectively suppress neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals with high spatiotemporal precision, opening new avenues for functional interrogation of long-range neuronal circuits \emph{in vivo}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30\textendash 70Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25{$\mu$}g), a GABAA receptor agonist, 15min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25{$\mu$}g) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14\textendash 0.21{$\mu$}g of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG\textendash saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG\textendash saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD.

Recent studies in the rat demonstrated that brainstem-generated theta rhythm occurs through a multisynaptic pathway via the nucleus incertus (NI), which is the primary source of the neuropeptide relaxin-3 (RLN3). Therefore, this study examined the possible contribution of RLN3 to MS activity, and associated hippocampal theta activity and spatial memory. In anesthetized and conscious rats, we identified the ability of intraseptal RLN3 signaling to modulate neuronal activity in the MS and hippocampus and promote hippocampal theta rhythm. Behavioral studies in a spontaneous alternation task indicated that endogenous RLN3 signaling within MS promoted spatial memory and exploratory activity significantly increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in RLN3-producing NI neurons. Anatomical studies demonstrated axons/terminals from NI/RLN3 neurons make close contact with septal GABAergic (and cholinergic) neurons, including those that project to the hippocampus. In summary, RLN3 neurons of the NI can modulate spatial memory and underlying hippocampal theta activity through axonal projections to pacemaker neurons of the MS. NI/RLN3 neurons are highly responsive to stress and express corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors, suggesting that the effects observed could be an important component of memory processing associated with stress responses.},

Glutamatergic neurones have also been recently described in this area but their function remains unknown. Here we show that local glutamatergic neurones can be activated using 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline in regular MS/DB slices, or mini-MS/DB slices. The spontaneous glutamatergic responses were mediated by AMPA receptors and, to a lesser extend, NMDA receptors, and were characterized by large, sometimes repetitive activity that elicited bursts of action potentials postsynaptically. Similar repetitive AMPA receptor-mediated bursts were generated by glutamatergic neurone activation within the MS/DB in disinhibited organotypic MS/DB slices, suggesting that the glutamatergic responses did not originate from extrinsic glutamatergic synapses. It is interesting that glutamatergic neurones were part of a synchronously active network as large repetitive AMPA receptor-mediated bursts were generated concomitantly with extracellular field potentials in intact half-septum preparations in vitro. Glutamatergic neurones appeared important to MS/DB activation as strong glutamatergic responses were present in electrophysiologically identified putative cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurones. In agreement with this, we found immunohistochemical evidence that vesicular glutamate-2 (VGLUT2)-positive puncta were in proximity to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)- and VGLUT2-positive neurones. Finally, MS/DB glutamatergic neurones could be activated under more physiological conditions as a cholinergic agonist was found to elicit rhythmic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSPs at a theta relevant frequency of 6\textendash 10 Hz. We propose that glutamatergic neurones within the MS/DB can excite cholinergic and GABAergic neurones, and that they are part of a connected excitatory network, which upon appropriate activation, may contribute to rhythm generation.},

  abstract = {The relationship between hippocampal electrical activity and behavioral hyperactivity induced by either phencyclidine (PCP) or methamphetamine (MAP) was examined in freely behaving rats. The EEGs at the hippocampal CA1 region were simultaneously recorded with the animal's behavior for 2 h after administration of either PCP or MAP. PCP (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) significantly increased locomotor activity including rearing, walking, head-weaving and circling. Spectral analysis of the EEG showed that hippocampal {$\gamma$} waves (30\textendash 70 Hz), but not other frequency bands, were significantly increased from 5 to 120 min after systemic injection of PCP. Inactivation of the medial septum with muscimol, a {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid receptor A agonist, 15 min prior to injection of PCP, suppressed both hippocampal {$\gamma$} waves and locomotor activity. MAP (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) also increased locomotor activity for longer than 2 h. During the behavioral hyperactivity induced by MAP, hippocampal EEG showed \texttheta{} and {$\gamma$} rhythms that were not significantly different from those during walking before MAP. However, MAP-induced behavioral activity was suppressed by pre-injection of muscimol in the medial septum, which also decreased hippocampal {$\gamma$} activity. It is suggested that the medial septum plays a role in mediating behavioral disturbances induced by both PCP and MAP through control of the hippocampal electrical activity, and that hippocampal {$\gamma$} waves may play a permissible role in the expression of behaviors.},

Seven days of auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Changes in activation responses were evident in microglia, astrocytes, and vasculature. Auditory GENUS also reduced phosphorylated tau in the P301S tauopathy model. Furthermore, combined auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in medial prefrontal cortex. Whole brain analysis using SHIELD revealed widespread reduction of amyloid plaques throughout neocortex after multi-sensory GENUS.

The metabolism of tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway and its involvement in mental disorders is an emerging area in psychiatry. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the differences in kynurenine metabolites in major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed metabolites involved in the kynurenine pathway (tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and their associate ratios) in people with MDD, SZ, or BD, compared to controls. We computed the difference in metabolite concentrations between people with MDD, BD, or SZ, and controls, presented as Hedges' g with 95\% confidence intervals. A total of 101 studies with 10,912 participants were included. Tryptophan and kynurenine are decreased across MDD, BD, and SZ; kynurenic acid and the kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid ratio are decreased in mood disorders (i.e., MDD and BD), whereas kynurenic acid is not altered in SZ; kynurenic acid to 3-hydroxykynurenine ratio is decreased in MDD but not SZ. Kynurenic acid to kynurenine ratio is decreased in MDD and SZ, and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio is increased in MDD and SZ. Our results suggest that there is a shift in the tryptophan metabolism from serotonin to the kynurenine pathway, across these psychiatric disorders. In addition, a differential pattern exists between mood disorders and SZ, with a preferential metabolism of kynurenine to the potentially neurotoxic quinolinic acid instead of the neuroprotective kynurenic acid in mood disorders but not in SZ.},

In addition, we hypothesize that septohippocampal GABAergic neurons generate an atropine-resistant theta rhythm that coexists with an atropine-sensitive theta rhythm in the hippocampus. Infusion of orexin-saporin (ore-SAP) into the medial septal area decreased parvalbumin-immunoreactive (GABAergic) neurons by {$\sim$}80\%, without significantly affecting choline-acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (cholinergic) neurons. The theta rhythm during walking, or the immobility-associated theta induced by pilocarpine, was not different between ore-SAP and sham-lesion rats. Walking theta was, however, more disrupted by atropine sulfate in ore-SAP than in sham-lesion rats. MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced hyperlocomotion associated with an increase in frequency, but not power, of the hippocampal theta in both ore-SAP and sham-lesion rats. However, MK-801 induced an increase in 71\textendash 100 Hz gamma waves in sham-lesion but not ore-SAP lesion rats. In sham-lesion rats, MK-801 induced an increase in locomotion and an impairment of prepulse inhibition (PPI), and ketamine (3 mg/kg s.c.) induced a loss of gating of hippocampal auditory evoked potentials. MK-801-induced behavioral hyperlocomotion and PPI impairment, and ketamine-induced auditory gating deficit were reduced in ore-SAP rats as compared to sham-lesion rats. During baseline without drugs, locomotion and auditory gating were not different between ore-SAP and sham-lesion rats, and PPI was slightly but significantly increased in ore-SAP as compared with sham lesion rats. It is concluded that septohippocampal GABAergic neurons are important for the expression of hyperactive and psychotic symptoms an enhanced hippocampal gamma activity induced by ketamine and MK-801, and for generating an atropine-resistant theta. Selective suppression of septohippocampal GABAergic activity is suggested to be an effective treatment of some symptoms of schizophrenia. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We investigated the development of EM in children 2\textendash 8 years of age (Study 1) and its impairment in Williams Syndrome, a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by visuospatial deficits and irregular hippocampal function, (Study 2) by implementing a nonverbal object-placement task that dissociates the what, where, and when components of EM. Consistent with the spatiotemporal-framework view of hippocampal EM, our results indicate that the binding of where and when in memory emerges earliest in development, around the age of 3, and is specifically impaired in WS. Space-time binding both preceded and was critical to full EM (what\,+\,where\,+\,when), and the successful~association of objects to spatial locations seemed to mediate this developmental process.},

The habenula, composed of medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb) domains, has been implicated in regulating behavioral flexibility and anxiety-related behaviors and is considered a core component of the brain ``anti-reward'' system. These functions position the habenula to influence voluntary behaviors. Consistent with this view, emerging evidence points to alterations in habenula activity as important factors to contributing the loss of control over the use of drugs of abuse and the emergence of compulsive drug seeking behaviors. In this review, we will discuss the general functions of the MHb and LHb and describe how these functional properties allow this brain region to promote or suppress volitional behaviors. Then, we highlight mechanisms by which drugs of abuse may alter habenular activity, precipitating the emergence of addiction-relevant behavioral abnormalities.},

Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography.

  abstract = {Cholinergic innervation of hippocampus and cortex is required for some forms of learning and memory. Several reports have shown that activation of muscarinic m1 receptors induces a long-term depression (mLTD) at glutamate synapses in hippocampus and in several areas of cortex, including perirhinal and visual cortices. This plasticity likely contributes to cognitive function dependent upon the cholinergic system. In rodent models, degeneration of hippocampal cholinergic innervation following lesion of the medial septum stimulates sprouting of adrenergic sympathetic axons, originating from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), into denervated hippocampal subfields. We previously reported that this adrenergic sympathetic sprouting occurs simultaneously with a reappearance of cholinergic fibers in hippocampus and rescue of mLTD at CA3-CA1 synapses. Because cholinergic neurons throughout basal forebrain degenerate in aging and Alzheimer's disease, it is critical to determine if this compensatory sprouting occurs in other regions impacted by cholinergic cell loss. To this end, we investigated whether lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NbM) to cholinergically denervate cortex stimulates adrenergic sympathetic sprouting and the accompanying increase in cholinergic innervation. Further, we assessed whether the presence of sprouting positively correlates with the ability of glutamate synapses in acute visual cortex slices to express mLTD and low frequency stimulation induced LTD (LFS LTD), another cholinergic dependent form of plasticity in visual cortex. We found that both mLTD and LFS LTD are absent in animals when NbM lesion is combined with bilateral removal of the SCG to prevent possible compensatory sprouting. In contrast, when the SCG remain intact to permit sprouting in animals with NbM lesion, cholinergic fiber density is increased concurrently with adrenergic sympathetic sprouting, and mLTD and LFS LTD are preserved. Our findings suggest that autonomic compensation for central cholinergic degeneration is not specific to hippocampus, but is a general repair mechanism occurring in other brain regions important for normal cognitive function.},

In Experiment 2, rats received lidocaine or saline infusions after exposure to the shock-probe (acquisition II).

Saporin lesions substantially reduced hippocampal cholinergic innervation, resulting in an absence of acetyl cholinesterase staining and markedly reduced choline acetyltransferase activity (mean reduction: 80 {$\pm$} 5\%; range: 50\textendash 97\%). However, the saporin-lesioned rats did not differ from control rats in any of the behavioral tests.

Anatomical studies have suggested that septal input to the granule cells may be to stratum moleculare, or close to the cell layer, or may not exist at all. The present experiments confirmed in rats anaesthetised with urethane that medial septal stimulation elicits single action potentials from cells in the granule layer. The associated negative field potential was maximal in the granule cell layer and there was no sign of a separate dendritic potential. The fibres responsible for this potential travel to the dorsal hippocampus in the fornix superior rather than the fimbria, taking the same course as the fibres which contribute to the dense cholinesterase staining just above the granule cell layer. Stimulation at 100 Hz for 1 s of either medial septal, or perforant path, input to the dentate granule cell layer produced long term potentiation of the subsequent evoked field responses to the stimulated pathway. The responses to the non-stimulated pathway were unchanged. Paired pulse stimulation produced both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic potentiation. These data suggest that medial septal input synapses close to granule cell bodies and produces a negative field potential which is a combination of dendritic and population spike potentials. Medial septal input also appeared to produce direct activation of hilar neurones, some of which may be basket cells or other interneurones. The data also show that long term potentiation is specific to this input, perhaps dependent on presynaptic mechanisms. Paired pulse potentiation, at least in the heterosynaptic case appears to depend on postsynaptic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that the foundation of mammalian spatial orientation and learning is based on an internal network that can keep track of relative position and orientation (from an arbitrary starting point) on the basis of integration of self-motion cues derived from locomotion, vestibular activation and optic flow (path integration).Place cells in the hippocampal formation exhibit elevated activity at discrete spots in a given environment, and this spatial representation is determined primarily on the basis of which cells were active at the starting point and how far and in what direction the animal has moved since then. Environmental features become associatively bound to this intrinsic spatial framework and can serve to correct for cumulative error in the path integration process.Theoretical studies suggested that a path integration system could involve cooperative interactions (attractor dynamics) among a population of place coding neurons, the synaptic coupling of which defines a two-dimensional attractor map. These cells would communicate with an additional group of neurons, the activity of which depends on the conjunction of movement speed, location and orientation (head direction) information, allowing position on the attractor map to be updated by self-motion information.The attractor map hypothesis contains an inherent boundary problem: what happens when the animal's movements carry it beyond the boundary of the map? One solution to this problem is to make the boundaries of the map periodic by coupling neurons at each edge to those on the opposite edge, resulting in a toroidal synaptic matrix. This solution predicts that, in a sufficiently large space, place cells would exhibit a regularly spaced grid of place fields, something that has never been observed in the hippocampus proper.Recent discoveries in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), the main source of hippocampal afferents, indicate that these cells do have regularly spaced place fields (grid cells). In addition, cells in the deeper layers of this structure exhibit grid fields that are conjunctive for head orientation and movement speed. Pure head direction neurons are also found there. Therefore, all of the components of previous theoretical models for path integration appear in the MEC, suggesting that this network is the core of the path integration system.The scale of MEC spatial firing grids increases systematically from the dorsal to the ventral poles of this structure, in much the same way as is observed for hippocampal place cells, and we show how non-periodic hippocampal place fields could arise from the combination of inputs from entorhinal grid cells, if the inputs cover a range of spatial scales rather than a single scale. This phenomenon, in the spatial domain, is analogous to the low frequency 'beats' heard when two pure tones of slightly different frequencies are combined.The problem of how a two-dimensional synaptic matrix with periodic boundary conditions, postulated to underlie grid cell behaviour, could be self-organized in early development is addressed. Based on principles derived from Alan Turing's theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking in chemical systems, we suggest that topographically organized, grid-like patterns of neural activity might be present in the immature cortex, and that these activity patterns guide the development of the proposed periodic synaptic matrix through a mechanism involving competitive synaptic plasticity.},

Astrocytic glial cells interact with synapses throughout the whole brain and are recognized as regulatory elements of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, it is largely unknown how GABAergic interneurons and astrocytes interact and contribute to stable performance of complex behaviors. Here, we found that genetic ablation of GABAB receptors in medial prefrontal cortex astrocytes altered low-gamma oscillations and firing properties of cortical neurons, which affected goal-directed behaviors. Remarkably, working memory deficits were restored by optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes with melanopsin. Furthermore, melanopsin-activated astrocytes in wild-type mice enhanced the firing rate of cortical neurons and gamma oscillations, as well as improved cognition. Therefore, our work identifies astrocytes as a hub for controlling inhibition in cortical circuits, providing a novel pathway for the behaviorally relevant midrange time-scale regulation of cortical information processing and consistent goal-directed behaviors.},

Although these anxiolytic effects occur after lesions to posterior (but not anterior) regions of the septum, their anatomical specificity has not been clearly defined with respect to classical subdivisions of the septum, such as the medial and lateral nuclei. Thus, in Experiment 1, we compared the effects of lateral or medial septal lesions on rats' anxiety reactions in the elevated plus-maze and shock-probe burying tests. Contrary to the ``anxiogenic'' effects of septal lesions recently found in a ``conflict'' model of anxiety, we found that both lateral and medial septal lesions produced equivalent anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze and shock-probe tests. In Experiment 2, we found similar anxiolytic effects whenever lesions included septal areas just anterior to the fornix (i.e., the lateral septum) but not when septal lesions were restricted to areas just posterior to the fornix (i.e., the septofimbrial and triangular septal nuclei). Taken together with our previous results, these data suggest that classical subdivisions of the septum bounded rostrally by the genu of the corpus callosum and caudally by the fornix play an exclusively excitatory role in the control of anxiety, as expressed in the plus-maze and shock-probe burying models.},

In contrast, measures of coherence and dynamic source synchronization allow for the study of functional and effective connectivity, respectively. Yet, these measures have rarely been assessed in parallel in the context of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and furthermore it has not been examined if they are related to risk factors of Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid deposition and apolipoprotein {$\epsilon$}4 (ApoE) allele occurrence. Here, we investigated functional and directed connectivities with Renormalized Partial Directed Coherence (RPDC) in 17 healthy controls (HC) and 17 participants with MCI. Participants underwent ApoE-genotyping and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) to assess amyloid deposition. We observed lower spectral source power in MCI in the alpha and beta bands. Coherence was stronger in HC than MCI across different neuronal sources in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. The directed coherence analysis indicated lower information flow between fronto-temporal (including the hippocampus) sources and unidirectional connectivity in MCI. In MCI, alpha and beta RPDC showed an inverse correlation to age and gender; global amyloid deposition was inversely correlated to alpha coherence, RPDC, and beta and gamma coherence. Furthermore, the ApoE status was negatively correlated to alpha coherence and RPDC, beta RPDC, and gamma coherence. A classification analysis of cognitive state revealed the highest accuracy using EEG power, coherence, and RPDC as input. For this small but statistically robust (Bayesian power analyses) sample, our results suggest that resting EEG related functional and directed connectivities are sensitive to the cognitive state and are linked to ApoE and amyloid burden.},

This leads to the hypothesis that this rhythm indicates a physiological state of the hippocampal formation which opposes its recruitment into seizures. This was tested by determining the effects of experimental induction or suppression of hippocampal theta activity on seizures. Hippocampal theta activity can be induced by chemical or electrical stimulation of the medial septal nucleus and adjacent nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. Microinjections of the muscarinic agonist carbachol in the medial septum during pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced facial-forelimb seizures stopped behavioral seizures and EEG spiking within five seconds, and caused hippocampal theta activity. Medial septal electrical stimulation at 4\textendash 8 Hz had similar effects. Electrolytic medial septal lesions abolished hippocampal theta activity and lowered myoclonic and facial-forelimb PTZ seizure thresholds. Medial septal carbachol injections were also made during electrically kindled limbic status epilepticus. Within ten seconds, ictal behavior stopped and the EEG spike rate decreased by half with a gradual return to the baseline rate over three minutes. These results demonstrate that the hippocampal theta rhythm corresponds to a seizure-resistant condition, providing a possible explanation for the seizure promoting properties of slow wave sleep.},

We took advantage of small animal positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) to probe in vivo metabolic activity in wild type Sprague Dawley rats during uncontrollable, inescapable, unpredictable foot-shock stress, and subsequently tested the animals response to controllable, escapable, predictable foot-shock stress. When we correlated metabolic activity during the uncontrollable stress with consequent behavioral outcomes, we found that the degree to which animals failed to escape the foot-shock correlated with increased metabolic activity in the lateral septum and habenula. When used a seed region, metabolic activity in the habenula correlated with activity in the lateral septum, hypothalamus, medial thalamus, mammillary nuclei, ventral tegmental area, central gray, interpeduncular nuclei, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, and rostromedial tegmental nucleus, caudal linear raphe, and subiculum transition area. Furthermore, the lateral septum correlated with metabolic activity in the preoptic area, medial thalamus, habenula, interpeduncular nuclei, periaqueductal gray, dorsal raphe, and caudal linear raphe.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a useful therapy for certain movement disorders and is increasingly being investigated for treatment of other neural circuit disorders. Here we review the rationale for investigating DBS as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Phase I clinical trials of DBS targeting memory circuits in Alzheimer's disease patients have shown promising results in clinical assessmentsof cognitive function, neurophysiological tests of cortical glucose metabolism, and neuroanatomical volumetric measurements showing reduced rates of atrophy. These findings have been supported by animal studies, where electrical stimulation of multiple nodes within the memory circuit have shown neuroplasticity through stimulation-enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and improved performance in memory tasks. The precise mechanisms by which DBS may enhance memory and cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease patients and the degree of its clinical efficacy continue to be examined in ongoing clinical trials.},

TI represents a potential breakthrough for treating conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and chronic pain. However, early clinical work on TI stimulation was met with mixed outcomes challenging its fundamental mechanisms and applications. Here, we apply established physics to study the mechanisms of TI with the goal of optimizing it for clinical use. We argue that TI stimulation cannot work via passive membrane filtering, as previously hypothesized. Instead, TI stimulation requires an ion-channel mediated signal rectification process. Unfortunately, this mechanism is also responsible for high-frequency conduction block in off-target tissues, thus challenging clinical applications of TI. In consequence, we propose a set of experimental controls that should be performed in future experiments to refine our understanding and practice of TI stimulation.

MSA lesions abolished or decreased theta rhythm in dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) and MEC; acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining was depleted or diminished in all of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Rats with MSA lesions were impaired on acquisition of a radial arm maze task. Unilateral fimbria lesions left theta rhythm and AChE staining essentially unaltered in ipsilateral DHPC and MEC but depleted AChE in ipsilateral ventral hippocampus (VHPC) and ventral lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). A lesion of the dorsal fornix at the level of the hippocampal flexure left ipsilateral DHPC theta rhythm and AChE stain unaltered while causing a substantial reduction in theta rhythm and depletion of AChE in ipsilateral MEC. AChE staining was complete in VHPC and LEC. These results suggest tha MSA paces MEC theta rhythm and that the presumed cholinergic projection which mediates this function travels in the dorsal fornix. The fimbria carries a presumed cholinergic projection to ventral LEC. Rats with MSA lesions can learn a radial arm maze task, unlike rats with fimbria- fornix lesions, but they learn significantly slower than normal rats.},

Astrocyte activation in the spinal cord is involved in the expression of neuropathic pain. We investigated the role of the ANLS in the spinal cord on hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain in mice. Specific activation of dorsal horn astrocytes induced mechanical hyperalgesia, which was attenuated by {$\alpha$}-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN), an inhibitor of monocarboxylate transporters that deliver L-lactate from astrocytes to neurons. Intrathecal L-lactate administration lowered the mechanical nociceptive threshold, which was attenuated by pretreatment with 4-CIN and isosafrole (a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor), but not gliotoxin. Intrathecal L-lactate administration significantly upregulated c-Fos and cofilin phosphorylation, which was reversed by 4-CIN. The lowered mechanical nociceptive threshold was significantly attenuated by intrathecal fluorocitrate (an astrocyte-specific Krebs cycle inhibitor), 4-CIN, and isosafrole treatment. Thus, these results suggested that, in neuropathic pain, mechanical hyperalgesia was maintained by excessive L-lactate supplied by activated astrocytes via an aberrant ANLS.},

In a series of behavioral, optogenetic, and electrophysiological experiments, Miyamoto et al. show that coordinated neuronal information flow during sleep is required for perceptual memory formation. Activity spreading from the secondary motor area (brain area M2) to the primary sensory region S1 is necessary for this particular kind of memory consolidation. Disturbing this coordinated input during slow-wave sleep immediately after memory acquisition prevented mice from learning a simple texture discrimination task. Science, this issue p. 1315 During tactile perception, long-range intracortical top-down axonal projections are essential for processing sensory information. Whether these projections regulate sleep-dependent long-term memory consolidation is unknown. We altered top-down inputs from higher-order cortex to sensory cortex during sleep and examined the consolidation of memories acquired earlier during awake texture perception. Mice learned novel textures and consolidated them during sleep. Within the first hour of non\textendash rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, optogenetic inhibition of top-down projecting axons from secondary motor cortex (M2) to primary somatosensory cortex (S1) impaired sleep-dependent reactivation of S1 neurons and memory consolidation. In NREM sleep and sleep-deprivation states, closed-loop asynchronous or synchronous M2-S1 coactivation, respectively, reduced or prolonged memory retention. Top-down cortical information flow in NREM sleep is thus required for perceptual memory consolidation. Perceptual memory consolidation needs temporal coordination of neurons in brain areas M2 and S1 during slow-wave sleep.

Using multi-regional large-scale electrophysiology in the aforementioned structures of fear-conditioned rats, we demonstrated that local ensembles activated during fear memory acquisition were inter-regionally coactivated during subsequent sleep, which relied on brief bouts of fast network oscillations. During memory retrieval, coactivations reappeared, accompanying fast oscillations. Ensembles contributing to inter-regional coactivation were configured prior to memory acquisition in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex but developed through experience in the hippocampus. Our observation suggests that elements of a given memory are instantly encoded within various brain regions in a pre-configured manner, whereas hippocampal ensembles and the network for inter-regional integration of the distributed information develop in an experience-dependent manner to form a new memory, which is consistent with hippocampal memory index hypothesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, we explored which serotonin projection areas contribute to these effects using optogenetic axon terminal stimulation. We found that serotonin stimulation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is nearly as effective as that in the DRN for promoting waiting, while in the nucleus accumbens, it does not promote waiting. We also found that serotonin stimulation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) promotes waiting only when the timing of future rewards is uncertain. Our Bayesian decision model of waiting assumed that the OFC and mPFC calculate the posterior probability of reward delivery separately. These results suggest that serotonin in the mPFC affects evaluation of time committed, while serotonin in the OFC is responsible for overall valuation of delayed rewards. Serotonergic projections to the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices modulate waiting for future rewards differently.

  abstract = {1. A comparison was made between the influences of supramammillary (SUM) and medial septal (MS) nuclei on hippocampal physiology in Nembutal-anesthetized rats. Specifically, the effects of prestimulation of the SUM or MS on the perforant path-dentate field potential, on spontaneous activity of single units, and on perforant path-induced unit activation were assessed. Another series of experiments addressed the issue of whether the SUM and MS effects on the perforant path-dentate field response are independent. 2. Prestimulation of the SUM or MS significantly facilitated the perforant path-dentate population spike with no clear effect on the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recorded in the subgranular zone of the dentate hilus. Prestimulation of either nucleus also reduced the threshold for spike onset. The major differences between the two spike facilitation effects were the magnitude of the change and possibly the optimal interstimulus intervals required to obtain the effects. 3. Acute transection of the ipsilateral column of fornix or dorsal fornix eliminated the SUM population spike facilitation effect. MS lesion or dorsal fornix/fimbria transection eliminated the MS spike facilitation effect. The MS lesion did not alter the effects of SUM prestimulation. Cingulum or medial forebrain bundle transection affected neither SUM- nor MS-mediated spike facilitation. Thus the SUM and MS influences on the dentate field response appear to be independent of one another. The relevant SUM afferents travel through the ipsilateral column of fornix and dorsal fornix, whereas MS afferents project through the dorsal fornix/fimbria. 4. Single units recorded in stratum granulosum (SG) were assessed with respect to several parameters. These included the mean firing rate, whether or not excitation occurred prior to the field population spike and at lower threshold, and whether or not a driven unit responded to a second perforant path stimulus delivered at short latency following the first (during the period of population spike depression). The latter parameter in particular appeared to separate SG cells into two classes. The cells that were not activated during the second field potential were classified as granule cells, whereas those that were activated were classified as basket cells. Based on this distinction, significant differences were also found between the two cell classes on the other parameters. In particular, cells classified as granule cells often had very low firing rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The contribution of the medial septum to different aspects of spatial information processing was assessed by examining the effects of reversible septal inactivation on radial maze performance of rats. In addition, the selectivity with which the medial septum affects learning was studied by testing the effects of septal inactivation on the acquisition of non-spatial information. Rats were first trained according to a spatial working memory procedure that included a 30-min delay between the first 4 (forced) choices and subsequent test (free) choices. The forced choices comprised the sample phase of the experiment while the free choices comprised the test phase. Saline or tetracaine (a local anesthetic) was injected into the medial septal area either before the sample phase, after the sample phase (i.e. at the beginning of the delay period), or just before the test phase. In contrast to the saline injections, tetracaine injected just before the samole or test phases produced a significant increase in errors at test. Tetracaine injection at the beginning of the delay period did not affect test choice accuracy. EEG records showed that septal inactivation drastically, yet temporarily, reduced the hippocampal {$\Theta$} rhythm. Thus, when septal inactivation occurred either before the sample phase or at the beginning of the delay period, hippocampal {$\Theta$} recovered by the time of the test phase. Septal inactivation also produced a significant retardation of learning on a non-spatial reference memory task, although clear improvement over trials did occur. Moreover, the results of subsequent saline injections suggest that at least some of the performance deficit was due to variables other than learning per se. Although such performance effects could at least in part account for the errors made when septal inactivation occurred before the test phase of the spatial task, it could not account for errors made when septal inactivation occurred before the sample phase. This result, together with the finding that septal inactivation drastically alters hippocampal single unit activity27, 28, is consistent with the hypothesis that normal septal activation (of perhaps the hippocampus) is required for acquisition of spatial information. Maintenance of spatial memory, on the other hand, may not rely on such activity.},

  abstract = {Goal-directed behavior requires integrating sensory information with prior knowledge about the environment. Behavioral biases that arise from these priors could increase positive outcomes when the priors match the true structure of the environment, but mismatches also happen frequently and could cause unfavorable outcomes. Biases that reduce gains and fail to vanish with training indicate fundamental suboptimalities arising from ingrained heuristics of the brain. Here, we report systematic, gain-reducing choice biases in highly trained monkeys performing a motion direction discrimination task where only the current stimulus is behaviorally relevant. The monkey's bias fluctuated at two distinct time scales: slow, spanning tens to hundreds of trials, and fast, arising from choices and outcomes of the most recent trials. Our findings enabled single trial prediction of biases, which influenced the choice especially on trials with weak stimuli. The pre-stimulus activity of neuronal ensembles in the monkey prearcuate gyrus represented these biases as an offset~along the decision axis in the state space. This offset persisted throughout the stimulus viewing period, when sensory information was integrated, leading to a biased choice. The pre-stimulus representation of history-dependent bias was functionally indistinguishable from the neural representation of upcoming choice before stimulus onset, validating our model of single-trial biases and suggesting that pre-stimulus representation of choice could be fully defined by biases inferred from behavioral history. Our results indicate that the prearcuate gyrus reflects intrinsic heuristics that compute bias signals, as well as the mechanisms that integrate them into the oculomotor decision-making process.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau proteins, which are believed to lead to neural damage that translates into brain dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Brain dysfunction can be evaluated by measuring single-neuron activity (spikes), global neural activity (local field potentials, LFPs) and the interaction between them. Considering that the dynamic interactions between the hippocampal pyramidal cells and lateral septum are important for proper structure function, we used the complete septo-hippocampal preparation from 30-day-old controls and J20-AD transgenic mice to record changes in spiking activity from the lateral septum and its relationship with LFP activity from the CA1 area. The cross-correlation analysis revealed that young J20 transgenic mice exhibit a significant reduction in coupling between lateral septum single-cell activity and neural network activity from the hippocampal CA1. Consistently, phase-lock analysis between lateral septum single-cell activity and CA1 neural network activity showed lower values in J20 transgenic mice. Similarly, the LFP- LFP coherence between CA1 and septum in the theta range showed lower values in J20 animals. Importantly, alterations were found before any detectable signs of cognitive deficits. Our data indicate that the disruption in the communication between hippocampus and rostral lateral septum is an early event in AD pathology and may contribute to the deficits observed during AD.},

Recent studies indicate that at the very early stage of this disease, increased phosphorylation in Tau's MDr domain correlates with reduced levels of neuronal excitability. Mechanistically, we show that pyramidal neurons and some parvalbumin-positive interneurons in 1-month-old triple-transgenic AD mice accumulate hyperphosphorylated Tau protein and that this accumulation correlates with changes in theta oscillations in hippocampal neurons. Pyramidal neurons from young triple-transgenic AD mice exhibited less spike accommodation and power increase in subthreshold membrane oscillations. Furthermore, triple-transgenic AD mice challenged with the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine had reduced theta amplitude compared with 4-aminopyridine\textendash treated control mice and, unlike these controls, displayed no seizure-like activity after this challenge. Collectively, our results provide new insights into AD pathogenesis and suggest that increases in Tau phosphorylation at the initial stages of the disease represent neuronal responses that compensate for brain circuit overexcitation.},

In the present study, we focused whether novel pyrrolidone nootropic drug sunifiram improves both memory impairment and depression observed in OBX mice. OBX mice were administered once a day for 7\textendash 12 days with sunifiram (0.01\textendash 1.0mg/kg p.o.) from 10 days after operation with or without gavestinel (10mg/kg i.p.), which is glycine-binding site inhibitor of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). The spatial reference memory assessed by Y-maze and short-term memory assessed by novel object recognition task were significantly improved by sunifiram treatment in OBX mice. Sunifiram also restored hippocampal LTP injured in OBX mice without treatment with gavestinel. By contrast, sunifiram treatment did not ameliorate the depressive behaviors assessed by tail suspension task in OBX mice. Notably, sunifiram treatment restored CaMKII{$\alpha$} (Thr-286) autophosphorylation and GluR1 (Ser-831) phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region from OBX mice to the levels of control mice. Likewise, sunifiram treatment improved PKC{$\alpha$} (Ser-657) autophosphorylation and NR1 (Ser-896) phosphorylation to the control levels. Stimulation of CaMKII and PKC autophosphorylation by sunifiram was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with gavestinel. However, sunifiram treatment did not affect the phosphorylation of CaMKIV (Thr-196) and ERK. Taken together, sunifiram ameliorates OBX-induced deficits of memory-related behaviors and impaired LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region via stimulation of glycine-binding site of NMDAR.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial assessed the safety and effectiveness of responsive cortical stimulation as an adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures in adults with medically refractory epilepsy. Methods: A total of 191 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy were implanted with a responsive neurostimulator connected to depth or subdural leads placed at 1 or 2 predetermined seizure foci. The neurostimulator was programmed to detect abnormal electrocorticographic activity. One month after implantation, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive stimulation in response to detections (treatment) or to receive no stimulation (sham). Efficacy and safety were assessed over a 12-week blinded period and a subsequent 84-week open-label period during which all subjects received responsive stimulation. Results: Seizures were significantly reduced in the treatment (-37.9\%, n = 97) compared to the sham group (-17.3\%, n = 94; p = 0.012) during the blinded period and there was no difference between the treatment and sham groups in adverse events. During the open-label period, the seizure reduction was sustained in the treatment group and seizures were significantly reduced in the sham group when stimulation began. There were significant improvements in overall quality of life (p {$<$} 0.02) and no deterioration in mood or neuropsychological function. Conclusions: Responsive cortical stimulation reduces the frequency of disabling partial seizures, is associated with improvements in quality of life, and is well-tolerated with no mood or cognitive effects. Responsive stimulation may provide another adjunctive treatment option for adults with medically intractable partial seizures. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that responsive cortical stimulation is effective in significantly reducing seizure frequency for 12 weeks in adults who have failed 2 or more antiepileptic medication trials, 3 or more seizures per month, and 1 or 2 seizure foci.},

  abstract = {Background The integration of EEG recordings and transcranial neuromodulation has provided a useful construct for noninvasively investigating the modification of human brain circuit activity. Recent evidence has demonstrated that focused ultrasound can be targeted through the human skull to affect the amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials and its associated spectral content. Objective/hypothesis The present study tests whether focused ultrasound transmitted through the human skull and targeted to somatosensory cortex can affect the phase and phase rate of cortical oscillatory dynamics. Methods A computational model was developed to gain insight regarding the insertion behavior of ultrasound induced pressure waves in the human head. The instantaneous phase and phase rate of EEG recordings before, during, and after transmission of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) to human somatosensory cortex were examined to explore its effects on phase dynamics. Results Computational modeling results show the skull effectively reinforces the focusing of tFUS due to curvature of material interfaces. Neurophysiological recordings show that tFUS alters the phase distribution of intrinsic brain activity for beta frequencies, but not gamma. This modulation was accompanied by a change in phase rate of both beta and gamma frequencies. Additionally, tFUS modulated phase distributions in the beta band of early sensory-evoked activity but did not affect late sensory-evoked activity, lending support to the spatial specificity of tFUS for neuromodulation. This spatial specificity was confirmed through an additional experiment where the ultrasound transducer was moved 1~cm laterally from the original cortical target. Conclusions Focused ultrasonic energy can alter EEG oscillatory dynamics through local mechanical perturbation of discrete cortical circuits.},

In the medial septum, cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons form a highly interconnected local network. Neurons of these three classes project to glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and different subsets of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. From there, GABAergic neurons project back to the medial septum and form a feedback loop between the two remote brain areas. In vivo, the firing of GABAergic medial septal neurons is theta modulated, while theta modulation is not observed in cholinergic neurons. One prominent feature of glutamatergic neurons is the correlation of their firing rates to the animals running speed. The cellular diversity, the high local interconnectivity and different activity patterns of medial septal neurons during different behaviors complicate the functional dissection of this network. New technical advances help to define specific functions of individual cell classes. In this review, we seek to highlight recent findings and elucidate functional implications of the septo-hippocampal connectivity on the microcircuit scale.},

We report the discovery that striatal astrocytes drive such phenotypes through a hitherto unknown synaptic mechanism. We found that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) triggered astrocyte signaling via {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptors. Selective chemogenetic activation of this pathway in striatal astrocytes~in~vivo resulted in acute behavioral hyperactivity and disrupted attention. Such responses also resulted in upregulation of the synaptogenic cue thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in astrocytes, increased excitatory synapses, enhanced corticostriatal synaptic transmission, and increased MSN action potential firing in~vivo. All of these changes were reversed by blocking TSP1 effects. Our data identify a form of bidirectional~neuron-astrocyte communication and demonstrate that acute reactivation of a single latent astrocyte synaptogenic cue alters striatal circuits controlling behavior, revealing astrocytes and the TSP1 pathway as therapeutic targets in hyperactivity, attention deficit, and related psychiatric disorders.},

This new version of the toxin is significantly more potent and selective than a previously developed version.

A complete loss of cholinergic neurons was seen in the medial septum (MS) with both doses, while a dose-dependent loss of cholinergic neurons was observed in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM). The lesions were associated with locomotor hypoactivity and anxiolytic-type behavioral effects.

Extrasynaptic GABAAR currents were potentiated rapidly after nerve injury in advance of remodeling.

Concordant shifts of visual features suggest movements of the observer, whereas discordant changes are more likely to be indicating independently moving objects, such as predators or prey.

However, the neural basis of distinguishing self-induced and self-independent visual motions is not clarified in unrestrained animals yet. In this study, we investigated the presence and origin of motion-related visual information in the striatum of rats, a hub of action selection and procedural memory. We found that while almost half of the neurons in the dorsomedial striatum are sensitive to visual motion congruent with locomotion (and that many of them also code for spatial location), only a small subset of them are composed of fast-firing interneurons that could also perceive self-independent visual stimuli. These latter cells receive their visual input at least partially from the secondary visual cortex (V2). This differential visual sensitivity may be an important support in adjusting behavior to salient environmental events. It emphasizes the importance of investigating visual motion perception in unrestrained animals.},

In the sensory thalamus, the thalamocortical neuron receives sensory afferents and massive feedback input from corticothalamic (CT) fibers. Notably, mGluR1 is more concentrated in CT synapses in the sensory thalamus. In the visual thalamus, mGluR1 maintains mature afferent synaptic connectivity. However, it is unknown whether mGluR1 contributes to strengthening of immature synapses or weakening of excess synapses during development and whether mGluR1 at CT synapses heterosynaptically regulates the development or refinement of afferent synapses. Here we investigated the effects of knocking out the gene encoding mGluR1 or pharmacologically blocking cortical activity on the development and maintenance of lemniscal synapses, i.e., the somatosensory afferent synapses, in the ventral posteromedial somatosensory thalamus. mGluR1-knockout (KO) mice exhibited delayed developmental strengthening as well as incomplete elimination and remodeling after maturation of lemniscal synapses. Similar to the phenotypes exhibited by mGluR1-KO mice, pharmacological blockade of somatosensory cortical activity from P12 or P21 for 1 week in wild-type mice perturbed elimination or maintenance of lemniscal synapses, respectively. The same manipulation in mGluR1-KO mice failed to induce additional abnormalities in lemniscal synaptic connectivity. These results suggest that activation of mGluR1, driven by CT input, regulates multiple stages of the development of lemniscal synapses, including strengthening, refinement, and maintenance in the somatosensory thalamus.},

Extracting the poses of animals without using markers is often essential for measuring behavioral effects in biomechanics, genetics, ethology \&amp; neuroscience. Yet, extracting detailed poses without markers in dynamically changing backgrounds has been challenging. We recently introduced an open source toolbox called DeepLabCut that builds on a state-of-the-art human pose estimation algorithm to allow a user to train a deep neural network using limited training data to precisely track user-defined features that matches human labeling accuracy. Here, with this paper we provide an updated toolbox that is self contained within a Python package that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces and active-learning based network refinement. Lastly, we provide a step-by-step guide for using DeepLabCut.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience. In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high-frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD), while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. Deep brain stimulation is now an established therapeutic approach that robustly alleviates symptoms in patients with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, who present with inadequate or adverse responses to medication. Currently, stimulation electrodes are implanted in specific target regions of the basal ganglia\textendash thalamic circuit and stimulation pulses are delivered chronically. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect, stimulation frequency, amplitude, and pulse width must be adjusted on a patient-specific basis by a movement disorders specialist. The finding that pathological neural activity can be sampled directly from the target region using the DBS electrode has inspired a novel DBS paradigm: closed-loop adaptive DBS (aDBS). The goal of this strategy is to identify pathological and physiologically normal patterns of neuronal activity that can be used to adapt stimulation parameters to the concurrent therapeutic demand. This review will give detailed insight into potential biomarkers and discuss next-generation strategies, implementing advances in artificial intelligence, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS by capitalizing on its modifiable nature. Development of intelligent aDBS, with an ability to deliver highly personalized treatment regimens and to create symptom-specific therapeutic strategies in real-time, could allow for significant further improvements in the quality of life for movement disorders patients with DBS that ultimately could outperform traditional drug treatment.},

Whereas the gamma oscillation has been studied for {$>$}50 yr, the beta oscillation has attracted attention only recently, and its origin, mechanism, and relationship to gamma are unknown. To address these questions, we have examined responses induced by odorants in the urethane-anesthetized rat\textemdash a preparation well-suited for the analysis of mechanisms. We found that both oscillations could be induced by odorants in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis with a concentration series and spectral methods revealed that the beta and gamma oscillations were distinct and not harmonically related, indicating generation by independent mechanisms. The beta oscillation was synchronous at sites {$\leq$}4 mm apart in the OB, the greatest distance tested. In contrast, the gamma oscillation was synchronous in some experiments and asynchronous in others (frequency differed slightly at different sites, resulting in progressive phase shifts). Current source-density analysis indicated that, for both oscillations, the field potentials in the OB were generated by synaptic currents in granule cells. The two oscillations were differently affected by surgical interruption of the lateral olfactory tract. This lesion abolished the beta oscillation, whereas the gamma oscillation was still induced in the OB. Our results confirm previous reports that the gamma oscillation is generated within the OB but indicate that the beta oscillation requires the participation of PC.},

  abstract = {A significant proportion of the electroencephalography (EEG) literature focuses on differences in historically pre-defined frequency bands in the power spectrum that are typically referred to as alpha, beta, gamma, theta and delta waves. Here we review 184 EEG studies that report differences in frequency bands in the resting state condition (eyes open and closed) across a spectrum of psychiatric disorders including depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, addiction, bipolar disorder, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia to determine patterns across disorders. Aggregating across all reported results we demonstrate that characteristic patterns of power change within specific frequency bands are not necessarily unique to any one disorder but show substantial overlap across disorders as well as variability within disorders. In particular, we show that the most dominant pattern of change, across several disorder types including ADHD, schizophrenia and OCD, is power increases across lower frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases across higher frequencies (alpha, beta and gamma). However, a considerable number of disorders, such as PTSD, addiction and autism show no dominant trend for spectral change in any direction. We report consistency and validation scores across the disorders and conditions showing that the dominant result across all disorders is typically only 2.2 times as likely to occur in the literature as alternate results, and typically with less than 250 study participants when summed across all studies reporting this result. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the results were infrequently reported and were typically small at between 20 to 30\% and correlated weakly with symptom severity scores. Finally, we discuss the many methodological challenges and limitations relating to such frequency band analysis across the literature. These results caution any interpretation of results from studies that consider only one disorder in isolation, and for the overall potential of this approach for delivering valuable insights in the field of mental health.},

  abstract = {Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal CA3 in vivo with and without simulated application of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic. Networks of 1200 multicompartment neurons [pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells] generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while OLM cells strongly contributed to theta. Extrinsic medial septal inputs paced theta and amplified both theta and gamma oscillations. Exploration of NMDA receptor reduction across all location combinations demonstrated that the experimentally observed ketamine effect occurred only with isolated reduction of NMDA receptors on OLMs. In the ketamine simulations, lower OLM activity reduced theta power and disinhibited pyramidal cells, resulting in increased basket cell activation and gamma power. Our simulations predict the following: (1) ketamine increases firing rates; (2) oscillations can be generated by intrinsic hippocampal circuits; (3) medial-septum inputs pace and augment oscillations; (4) pyramidal cells lead basket cells at the gamma peak but lag at trough; (5) basket cells amplify theta rhythms; (6) ketamine alters oscillations due to primary blockade at OLM NMDA receptors; (7) ketamine alters phase relationships of cell firing; (8) ketamine reduces network responsivity to the environment; (9) ketamine effect could be reversed by providing a continuous inward current to OLM cells. We suggest that this last prediction has implications for a possible novel treatment for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by targeting OLM cells.},

In the present study, we demonstrated a role for GSK-3 in the direct regulation of neuronal oscillations in hippocampus (HIP) and prelimbic cortex (PL). A comparison of the GSK-3 inhibitors SB 216763 and lithium demonstrated disparate effects of the drugs on spatial memory and neural oscillatory activity in HIP and PL. SB 216763 administration improved spatial memory whereas lithium treatment had no effect. Analysis of neuronal local field potentials in anesthetized animals revealed that whereas both repeated SB 216763 (2.5 mg/kg) and lithium (100 mg/kg) induced a theta frequency spike in HIP at approximately 10 Hz, only SB 216763 treatment induced an overall increase in theta power (4-12 Hz) compared to vehicle. Acute administration of either drug suppressed slow (32-59 Hz) and fast (61-100 Hz) gamma power. In PL, both drugs induced an increase in theta power. Repeated SB 216763 increased HIP-PL coherence across all frequencies except delta, whereas lithium selectively suppressed delta coherence. These findings demonstrate that GSK-3 plays a direct role in the regulation of theta oscillations in regions critically involved in cognition, and highlight a potential mechanism by which GSK-3 may contribute to cognitive decline in disorders of cognitive dysfunction.},

Through ascending cholinergic connections from the brainstem, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is physiologically characterized by low voltage fast activity on the electroencephalogram, REMs, and muscle atonia. Multiple independent studies confirm that, in REM sleep, there is a strikingly low proportion of seizures (\textasciitilde 1\% or less). We review a total of 42 distinct conventional and intracranial studies in the literature which comprised a net of 1458 patients. Indexed to duration, we found that REM sleep was the most protective stage of sleep against focal seizures, generalized seizures, focal interictal discharges, and two particular epilepsy syndromes. REM sleep had an additional protective effect compared to wakefulness with an average 7.83 times fewer focal seizures, 3.25 times fewer generalized seizures, and 1.11 times fewer focal interictal discharges. In further studies REM sleep has also demonstrated utility in localizing epileptogenic foci with potential translation into postsurgical seizure freedom. Based on emerging connectivity data in sleep, we hypothesize that the influence of REM sleep on seizures is due to a desynchronized EEG pattern which reflects important connectivity differences unique to this sleep stage.},

  abstract = {We understand this review as an attempt to summarize recent advances in the understanding of cholinergic function in cognition. Such a role has been highlighted in the 1970s by the discovery that dementia patients have greatly reduced cholinergic activity in cortex and hippocampus. A brief anatomical description of the major cholinergic pathways focuses on the basal forebrain and its projections to cortex and hippocampus. From this distinction, compelling evidence suggests that the basal forebrain \textrightarrow{} cortex projection regulates the excitability of principal cortical neurons and is thereby critically involved in attention, stimulus detection and memory function, although the biological conditions for these functions are still debated. Similar uncertainties remain for the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system. Although initial lesions of the septum caused memory deficits reminiscent of hippocampal ablations, recent and more refined neurotoxic lesion studies which spared non-cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain failed to confirm these memory impairments in experimental animals despite a near total loss of cholinergic labeling. Yet, a decline in cholinergic markers in aging and dementia still stands as the most central piece of evidence for a link between the cholinergic system and cognition and appear to provide valuable targets for therapeutic approaches.},

Materials and Methods A total of 16 Lewis rats were used in this study. Facial nerve paralysis was created by ligating facial nerve trunk with a ligature clip. The rats were divided into 3 groups. Nerve conduit group (n = 6) were treated by IPJG with collagen-coated PGA tubes between the facial nerve trunks and the hypoglossal nerves. Autograft group (n = 6) were treated by IPJG with the greater auricular nerves. As the control group (n = 4), non-treated-model rats with facial nerve paralysis were used. The number of myelinated fibers, fiber diameter, axon diameter, myelin thickness, and g-ratio, were analyzed histologically at 13 weeks after surgery. Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and retrograde tracing were measured. Result Although the number of myelinated fibers in autograft group (1957 {$\pm$} 775) had significantly higher than that of nerve conduit group (90 {$\pm$} 41, P {$<$} .05), the nerve conduit group showed the regeneration of myelinated nerve axons. CMAP amplitude values of the autograft (4706 {$\pm$} 1154 \textmu V) and the nerve conduit groups (4119 {$\pm$} 1397 \textmu V) were significantly higher than that of the control group (915 {$\pm$} 789 \textmu V, P {$<$} .05). Retrograde tracing confirmed the double innervation of mimetic muscles by the facial and hypoglossal nucleus in both groups. Conclusion This study showed histologically and physiologically the superior effectiveness of performing IPJG with a collagen-coated PGA conduit in a rat model.},

Resting-state gamma power and theta\textendash gamma coupling (TGC) were calculated before and after a course of rTMS. We explored the relationship among gamma power, TGC, and clinical/cognitive outcomes as measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Results Following rTMS, depressed patients demonstrated significant increases of resting gamma power at the F3 and F4 electrode sites and resting TGC at the C3 and T3 electrode sites. Furthermore, the increased gamma power at the F3 electrode site was significantly correlated with improved score on the HAM-D17 and BDI, while the increased TGC at the C3 electrode site was significantly correlated with reduced number of errors on the WCST. Conclusion Thus, resting-state gamma power and TGC may represent potential biomarkers of depression associated with therapeutic effects of rTMS.

Optogenetic manipulations of this pathway collectively support the model that rhythmic modulation of ACAVIS neurons in anticipation of visual stimuli is crucial for adjusting performance following errors. 30-Hz optogenetic stimulation of ACAVIS neurons in anesthetized mice recapitulates the increased gamma and reduced theta VIS oscillatory changes that are associated with endogenous post-error performance during behavior and subsequently increased visually evoked spiking, a hallmark feature of visual attention. This frontal sensory neural circuit links error monitoring with implementing adjustments of attention to guide behavioral adaptation, pointing to a circuit-based mechanism for promoting cognitive control.},

Here, we answer this question with simultaneous fUSI and neural recordings with Neuropixels probes in awake mice. fUSI signals strongly correlated with the slow (\&lt;0.3 Hz) fluctuations in firing rate measured in the same location and were closely predicted by convolving the firing rate with a 2.9 s wide linear filter. This filter matched the hemodynamic response function of awake mouse and was invariant across mice, stimulus conditions, and brain regions. fUSI signals matched neural firing also spatially: recordings with two probes revealed that firing rates were as highly correlated across hemispheres as fUSI signals. We conclude that fUSI signals bear a simple linear relationship to neuronal firing and accurately reflect neural activity both in time and in space.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

First, the mechanisms of hippocampal theta are becoming clear, as is its role in spatial coding; each theta cycle appears to act as a clock mechanism against which the firing of the place cells can be timed. Second, there has been a continued strengthening in the support for the spatial theory of hippocampal function from single unit and lesion experiments; particularly important is the finding that the deficit in (non-spatial) delayed non-match to sample memory experiments in the monkey following medial temporal lobe damage stems from the part of the cortex which surrounds the hippocampus, and not from the hippocampus itself. Third, in contrast, it is proving more difficult than originally thought to show a causal relationship between long-term potentiation at the synaptic level and place learning-induced changes in hippocampal synapses.},

In contrast, the hippocampal electroer cephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7\textendash 12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100\textdegree{} to 355\textdegree{} in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

Displace units increased their rates during behaviors associated with theta activity in the hippocampal slow waves. In general these were behaviors which changed the rat's position relative to the environment. The influence of various environmental manipulations (e.g., turning off the room lights) on the firing pattern of the place units was tested and the results suggest that they were not responding to a simple sensory stimulus nor to a specific motor behavior.

The hypothalamus contained dense plexuses of fibers in the medial forebrain bundle that spread in nearly all nuclei. Labeling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus filled specifically the ventral half. In the midbrain, labeled fibers were observed in the interpeduncular nuclei, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, pericentral inferior colliculus, pretectal area, the raphe nuclei, and the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. Retrograde tracer injections were made in areas reached by anterogradely labeled fibers including the medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, habenula, nucleus reuniens, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, and interpeduncular nuclei. All these injections gave rise to retrograde labeling in the nucleus incertus but not in the dorsal tegmental nucleus.

Most stimulators work in open-loop mode, applying continuous stimulation with no consideration of patients' symptoms. Now, Opri et al. developed a closed-loop system for thalamic DBS (CL-DBS) and tested in three patients with ET. CL-DBS delivered the therapeutic stimuli based on upper limb motor activity detected with a cortical electrode. The system was as effective as the open-loop stimulation while preserving energy. The results suggest that CL-DBS could save energy and possibly reduce side effects associated with continuous DBS. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved therapy for the treatment of medically refractory and severe movement disorders. However, most existing neurostimulators can only apply continuous stimulation [open-loop DBS (OL-DBS)], ignoring patient behavior and environmental factors, which consequently leads to an inefficient therapy, thus limiting the therapeutic window. Here, we established the feasibility of a self-adjusting therapeutic DBS [closed-loop DBS (CL-DBS)], fully embedded in a chronic investigational neurostimulator (Activa PC + S), for three patients affected by essential tremor (ET) enrolled in a longitudinal (6 months) within-subject crossover protocol (DBS OFF, OL-DBS, and CL-DBS). Most patients with ET experience involuntary limb tremor during goal-directed movements, but not during rest. Hence, the proposed CL-DBS paradigm explored the efficacy of modulating the stimulation amplitude based on patient-specific motor behavior, suppressing the pathological tremor on-demand based on a cortical electrode detecting upper limb motor activity. Here, we demonstrated how the proposed stimulation paradigm was able to achieve clinical efficacy and tremor suppression comparable with OL-DBS in a range of movements (cup reaching, proximal and distal posture, water pouring, and writing) while having a consistent reduction in energy delivery. The proposed paradigm is an important step toward a behaviorally modulated fully embedded DBS system, capable of delivering stimulation only when needed, and potentially mitigating pitfalls of OL-DBS, such as DBS-induced side effects and premature device replacement. Effective tremor suppression in ET with half the energy requirements was achieved by on-demand DBS based on real-time cortical sensing. Effective tremor suppression in ET with half the energy requirements was achieved by on-demand DBS based on real-time cortical sensing.},

Simultaneous recording of the multiunit activity across subregions reveals that Dys responses are selective to noxious input whereas those of BF are to tactile input. At the single neuron level, nociceptive information is represented separately from the tactile information in Dys layer 2/3. In contrast, both modalities are converged in a layer 5 neuron in each region. Interestingly, the two modalities interfere with each other in both regions.

  abstract = {The theoretical basis of some deep brain stimulation (DBS) trials undertaken in the early years was the phenomenon of ``brain stimulation reward (BSR),'' which was first identified in rats. The animals appeared to be rewarded by pleasure caused by the stimulation of certain brain regions (reward system), such as the septal area. ``Self-stimulation'' experiments, in which rats were allowed to stimulate their own brain by pressing a freely accessible lever, they quickly learned lever pressing and sometimes continued to stimulate until they exhausted themselves. BSR was also observed with DBS of the septal area in humans. DBS trials in later years were undertaken on other theoretical bases, but unexpected BSR was sometimes induced by stimulation of some areas, such as the locus coeruleus complex. When BSR was induced, the subjects experienced feelings that were described as ``cheerful,'' ``alert,'' ``good,'' ``well-being,'' ``comfort,'' ``relaxation,'' ``joy,'' or ``satisfaction.'' Since the DBS procedure is equivalent to a ``self-stimulation'' experiment, they could become ``addicted to the stimulation itself'' or ``compulsive about the stimulation,'' and stimulate themselves ``for the entire day,'' ``at maximum amplitude'' and, in some instances, ``into convulsions.'' DBS of the reward system has recently been applied to alleviate anhedonia in patients with refractory major depression. Although this approach appears promising, there remains a difficult problem: who can adjust their feelings and reward-oriented behavior within the normal range? With a self-stimulation procedure, the BSR may become uncontrollable. To develop DBS to the level of a standard therapy for mental disorders, we need to discuss ``Who has the right to control the mental condition?'' and ``Who makes decisions'' on ``How much control is appropriate?'' in daily life.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Neural oscillations have been proposed as a mechanism for structure building in language and music. In music, this idea is appealing because of the intuitive mapping between perceptual and neural rhythms. The strongest evidence has come from studies in which participants listened to isochronous sequences of identical tones and were asked to imagine hearing them in binary (march) or ternary meter (waltz). The critical finding was that in addition to increased signal at the frequency corresponding to the tone rate there was increased signal at the imagined meter frequencies. While it is striking that meter tracking was observed without any acoustic cues in the input, rhythm perception was confounded with rhythm imagery involving active generation of rhythmic structure. We conducted two electroencephalography experiments with musicians and non-musicians, teasing apart the effects of rhythm perception and rhythm generation. Evidence for meter-related neural oscillations was only observed in situations where rhythmic structure was actively generated, either via rhythm imagery or in the form of overt behavior (tapping). Thus, our data suggest that mere rhythm perception is not sufficient to elicit oscillations at the meter frequency and that they are instead driven by the active generation of rhythm. This undermines the proposal that neural oscillations constitute a basic structure building mechanism in rhythm perception and raises questions about the role of oscillations in language processing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here, combining optogenetics-based mapping with ex~vivo and in~vivo physiology, we examine the synaptic properties of posterior septal afferents to the MHb and how they influence behavior. We demonstrate that MHb cells receive sparse inputs producing purely glutamatergic responses via calcium-permeable {$\alpha$}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), heterotrimeric GluN2A-GluN2B-GluN1 N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and inhibitory group II metabotropic glutamate receptors. We describe the complex integration dynamics of these components by MHb cells. Finally, we combine ex~vivo data with realistic afferent firing patterns recorded in~vivo to demonstrate that efficient optogenetic septal stimulation in the MHb induces anxiolysis and promotes locomotion, contributing long-awaited evidence in favor of the importance of this septo-habenular pathway.},

  abstract = {A brain-to-brain interface (BTBI) enabled a real-time transfer of behaviorally meaningful sensorimotor information between the brains of two rats. In this BTBI, an ``encoder'' rat performed sensorimotor tasks that required it to select from two choices of tactile or visual stimuli. While the encoder rat performed the task, samples of its cortical activity were transmitted to matching cortical areas of a ``decoder'' rat using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The decoder rat learned to make similar behavioral selections, guided solely by the information provided by the encoder rat's brain. These results demonstrated that a complex system was formed by coupling the animals' brains, suggesting that BTBIs can enable dyads or networks of animal's brains to exchange, process and store information and, hence, serve as the basis for studies of novel types of social interaction and for biological computing devices.},

Neuronal circuits vulnerable to AD are also affected in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. hAPP mice with high levels of amyloid-b peptides in the brain develop ADlike abnormalities, including cognitive deficits and depletions of calcium-related proteins in the dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in learning and memory. Here, we report that hAPP mice have spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, which is associated with GABAergic sprouting, enhanced synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many Ab-induced neuronal alterations could be simulated in nontransgenic mice by excitotoxin challenge and prevented in hAPP mice by blocking overexcitation. Aberrant increases in network excitability and compensatory inhibitory mechanisms in the hippocampus may contribute to Ab-induced neurological deficits in hAPP mice and, possibly, also in humans with AD.},

On the basis of the excitotoxic damage of GABAergic MSDB neurons, we have recently suggested a role for these neurons in controlling proactive interference. Our study sought to test this hypothesis in different behavioral procedures using a new GABAergic immunotoxin. GABA-transporter-saporin (GAT1-SAP) was administered into the MSDB of male Sprague\textendash Dawley rats. Following surgery, rats were trained in a reference memory water maze procedure for 5 days, followed by a working memory (delayed match to position) water maze procedure. Other rats were trained in a lever-press avoidance procedure after intraseptal GAT1-SAP or sham surgery. Intraseptal GAT1-SAP extensively damaged GABAergic neurons while sparing most cholinergic MSDB neurons. Rats treated with GAT1-SAP were not impaired in acquiring a spatial reference memory, learning the location of the escape platform as rapidly as sham rats. In contrast, GAT1-SAP rats were slower than sham rats to learn the platform location in a delayed match to position procedure, in which the platform location was changed every day. Moreover, GAT1-SAP rats returned to previous platform locations more often than sham rats. In the active avoidance procedure, intraseptal GAT1-SAP impaired extinction but not acquisition of the avoidance response. Using a different neurotoxin and behavioral procedures than previous studies, the results of this study paint a similar picture that GABAergic MSDB neurons are important for controlling proactive interference. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A similar `selection' mechanism is thought to control the representations held `in mind'\textemdash in working memory5\textendash 10. Here we show that shared neural mechanisms underlie the selection of items from working memory and attention to sensory stimuli. We trained rhesus monkeys to switch between two tasks, either selecting one item from a set of items held in working memory or attending to one stimulus from a set of visual stimuli. Neural recordings showed that similar representations in prefrontal cortex encoded the control of both selection and attention, suggesting that prefrontal cortex acts as a domain-general controller. By contrast, both attention and selection were represented independently in parietal and visual cortex. Both selection and attention facilitated behaviour by enhancing and transforming the representation of the selected memory or attended stimulus. Specifically, during the selection task, memory items were initially represented in independent subspaces of neural activity in prefrontal cortex. Selecting an item caused its representation to transform from its own subspace to a new subspace used to guide behaviour. A similar transformation occurred for attention. Our results suggest that prefrontal cortex controls cognition by dynamically transforming representations to control what and when cognitive computations are engaged.},

Immunoreactive fibers were observed in almost all major regions of the brain. They were most numerous in the different hypothalamic nuclei. Dense networks of immunoreactive fibers were also seen in the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band and ventral tegmental area. A moderate density of fibers was seen throughout the cerebral cortex, in some parts of the olfactory bulb and tubercle, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, basal parts of the hippocampus, inferior and superior colliculi, substantia nigra, lateral and medial parabrachial nucleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Few histamineimmunoreactive fibers were seen in most parts of the caudate putamen, most thalamic nuclei, most pontine and ventral medullary nuclei. Histamine-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies were found exclusively in the tuberomammillary nucleus, in agreement with previous reports. The results provide evidence for a widespread distribution of histamine-containing nerve fibers and terminals in the rat brain. Although immunohistochemical localization of histamine does not give direct evidence of a functional role of histamine in any brain area, this distribution suggests involvement in functions of the limbic system including the septal nuclei, hypothalamus and amygdala. The relatively dense histamine-immunoreactive fiber networks in the colliculi and dorsal cochlear nucleus indicate that this amine may play a role in visual functions and hearing. The paucity of immunoreactive fibers in the pontine and medullary areas suggests that the caudal projections originating from the tuberomammillary complex are minor ones compared to the major rostral projections. Several fiber projections originating from the tuberomammillary complex could be deduced from serial frontal, sagittal and horizontal sections. They contained fibers that crossed the midline at several levels of the brain. The results provide information on the target areas of the histaminergic neurons and form a basis for the examination of cellular contracts between the histaminergic neurons and other cells.},

In a first series of experiments, the lectin wheat germ-agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) was injected into all major sensory, motor, intralaminar, and reticular (RE) thalamic nuclei of cats and into the mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar-lateroposterior thalamic nuclei of macaque monkeys. In cats numerous neurons of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band nucleus and the substantia innominata (SI), including its rostromedial portion termed the ventral pallidum (VP), were retrogradely labeled after WGA-HRP injections in the rostral pole of the RE complex, the MD, and anteroventral/anteromedial (AV/AM) thalamic nuclei. Fewer retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the same areas after injections in the ventromedial (VM) thalamic nucleus, and none or very few after other thalamic injections. After RE, MD, and AV/AM injections, 7\textendash 20\% of all retrogradely labeled cells in the basal forebrain were also ChAT positive, while none of the retrogradely labeled neurons following VM injections displayed ChAT immunoreactivity. The basal forebrain projection to the MD nucleus was shown to arise principally from VP in both cats and macaque monkeys. In a second series of experiments performed in cats, injections of WGA-HRP in the brainstem peribrachial (PB) area comprising the pedunculopontine nucleus led to retrograde labeling of a moderate number of neurons in the lateral part of the VP, SI, and preoptic area (POA), only a few of which displayed ChAT immunoreactivity. In addition, a large number of retrogradely labeled cells were observed in the bed nuclei of the anterior commissure and stria terminalis after PB injections. In a third series of experiments, the use of the retrograde double-labeling method with fluorescent tracers in squirrel monkeys allowed us to identify a significant number of basal forebrain neurons sending axon collaterals to both the RE thalamic nucleus and PB brainstem area, while no double-labeled neurons were disclosed after injections confined to the ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei and PB area or following injections in the cerebral cortex and PB area. Our findings reveal the existence of cholinergic and noncholinergic basal forebrain projections to the thalamus and the brainstem in both cats and macaque monkeys.

  abstract = {Anxiety is an adaptive response to potentially threatening situations. Exaggerated and uncontrolled anxiety responses become maladaptive and lead to anxiety disorders. Anxiety is shaped by a network of forebrain structures, including the hippocampus, septum, and prefrontal cortex. In particular, neural inputs arising from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the lateral septum (LS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are thought to serve as principal components of the anxiety circuit. However, the role of vHPC-to-LS and vHPC-to-mPFC signals in anxiety is unclear, as no study has directly compared their behavioral contribution at circuit level. We targeted LS-projecting vHPC cells and mPFC-projecting vHPC cells by injecting the retrogradely propagating canine adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase into the LS or mPFC, and injecting a Cre-responsive AAV (AAV8-hSyn-FLEX-hM3D or hM4D) into the vHPC. Consequences of manipulating these neurons were examined in well-established tests of anxiety. Chemogenetic manipulation of LS-projecting vHPC cells led to bidirectional changes in anxiety: activation of LS-projecting vHPC cells decreased anxiety whereas inhibition of these cells produced opposite anxiety-promoting effects. The observed anxiety-reducing function of LS-projecting cells was in contrast with the function of mPFC-projecting cells, which promoted anxiety. In addition, double retrograde tracing demonstrated that LS- and mPFC-projecting cells represent two largely anatomically distinct cell groups. Altogether, our findings suggest that the vHPC houses discrete populations of cells that either promote or suppress anxiety through differences in their projection targets. Disruption of the intricate balance in the activity of these two neuron populations may drive inappropriate behavioral responses seen in anxiety disorders.},

Thus, understanding whether and how novelty prepares, or primes, brain circuitry to facilitate cognitive flexibility has important translational relevance. Exposure to novelty recruits the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)2 and may prime hippocampal\textendash prefrontal circuitry for subsequent learning-associated plasticity. Here we show that novelty resets the neural circuits that link the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the mPFC, facilitating the ability to overcome an established strategy. Exposing mice to novelty disrupted a previously encoded strategy by reorganizing vHPC activity to local theta (4\textendash 12~Hz) oscillations and weakening existing vHPC\textendash mPFC connectivity. As mice subsequently adapted to a new task, vHPC neurons developed new task-associated activity, vHPC\textendash mPFC connectivity was strengthened, and mPFC neurons updated to encode the new rules. Without novelty, however,~mice adhered to their established strategy. Blocking dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) or inhibiting novelty-tagged cells that express D1Rs in the vHPC prevented these behavioural and physiological effects of novelty. Furthermore, activation of D1Rs mimicked the effects of novelty. These results suggest that novelty promotes adaptive learning by D1R-mediated resetting of vHPC\textendash mPFC circuitry, thereby enabling subsequent~learning-associated circuit plasticity.},

We trained rats to perform a two-arm bandit-task, successfully adjusting choices between certain-small or possible-big rewards with changing long-term advantages. We discovered specialized prefrontal neurons, whose firing during the encounter of no-reward predicted the subsequent choice of animals, even for unlikely or uncertain decisions and several seconds before choice execution. Optogenetic silencing of the prelimbic cortex exclusively timed to encounters of no reward, provoked animals to excessive gambling for large rewards. Firing of prefrontal neurons during outcome evaluation signals subsequent choices during gambling and is essential for dynamically adjusting decisions based on internal valuations.},

Pederick et al. analyzed how parallel circuits in the mouse medial and lateral hippocampus develop without getting tangled up. Regulated expression of the cell surface molecules teneurin-3 (Ten3) and latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) keeps confusion at bay. Together, these factors act as a membrane-bound ligand-receptor pair with repulsive outcomes, and they are able to destabilize a nascent but incorrect axon-target interaction. Individually, they each mediate homophilic attraction as axons search for their favored targets. Science, abg1774, this issue p. 1068 Mammalian medial and lateral hippocampal networks preferentially process spatial- and object-related information, respectively. However, the mechanisms underlying the assembly of such parallel networks during development remain largely unknown. Our study shows that, in mice, complementary expression of cell surface molecules teneurin-3 (Ten3) and latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) in the medial and lateral hippocampal networks, respectively, guides the precise assembly of CA1-to-subiculum connections in both networks. In the medial network, Ten3-expressing (Ten3+) CA1 axons are repelled by target-derived Lphn2, revealing that Lphn2- and Ten3-mediated heterophilic repulsion and Ten3-mediated homophilic attraction cooperate to control precise target selection of CA1 axons. In the lateral network, Lphn2-expressing (Lphn2+) CA1 axons are confined to Lphn2+ targets via repulsion from Ten3+ targets. Our findings demonstrate that assembly of parallel hippocampal networks follows a ``Ten3\textrightarrow Ten3, Lphn2\textrightarrow Lphn2'' rule instructed by reciprocal repulsions.

Electrical measurements of large-scale brain dynamics, termed field potentials, are especially important to understanding and treating the human brain. Here, our goal is to provide best practices on how field potential recordings (electroencephalograms, magnetoencephalograms, electrocorticograms and local field potentials) can be analyzed to identify large-scale brain dynamics, and to highlight critical issues and limitations of interpretation in current work. We focus our discussion of analyses around the broad themes of activation, correlation, communication and coding. We provide recommendations for interpreting the data using forward and inverse models. The forward model describes how field potentials are generated by the activity of populations of neurons. The inverse model describes how to infer the activity of populations of neurons from field potential recordings. A recurring theme is the challenge of understanding how field potentials reflect neuronal population activity given the complexity of the underlying brain systems.},

To quantify, compare, and visualize the functional features of single neurons, we have developed the open-source framework, CellExplorer. It consists of three components: a processing module that calculates standardized physiological metrics, performs neuron type classification and detects putative monosynaptic connections, a flexible data structure, and a powerful graphical interface. The graphical interface makes it possible to explore any combination of pre-computed features at the speed of a mouse click. The CellExplorer framework allows users to process and relate their data to a growing collection of ``ground truth'' neurons from different genetic lines, as well as to tens of thousands of single neurons collected across our labs. We believe CellExplorer will accelerate the linking of physiological properties of single neurons in the intact brain to genetically identified types.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The medial septum (MS) is critical in theta generation by two possible mechanisms: either a unitary ``pacemaker'' timing signal is imposed on the hippocampal system, or it may assist in organizing target subcircuits within the phase space of theta oscillations. We used temperature manipulation of the MS to test these models. Cooling of the MS reduced both theta frequency and power and was associated with an enhanced incidence of errors in a spatial navigation task, but it did not affect spatial correlates of neurons. MS cooling decreased theta frequency oscillations of place cells and reduced distance-time compression but preserved distance-phase compression of place field sequences within the theta cycle. Thus, the septum is critical for sustaining precise theta phase coordination of cell assemblies in the hippocampal system, a mechanism needed for spatial memory.},

Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as `replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.},

In order to investigate this question, we trained rats to run the Multiple-T Left Right Alternate (MT-LRA) task and recorded multi-unit ensembles from their prelimbic regions. Significant populations of cells in the prelimbic cortex represented the strategy controlling reward receipt on a given lap, whether the animal chose to go right or left on a given lap, and whether the animal made a correct decision or an error on a given lap. These populations overlapped in the cells recorded, with several cells demonstrating differential firing to all three variables. The spatial and strategic firing patterns of individual prelimbic cells were highly conserved across several days of running this task, indicating that each cell encoded the same information across days.},

NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.},

  abstract = {Background TMS has high potential as smoking cessation treatment. However, the neural mechanisms underlying TMS induced reduction of tobacco craving remain unclear. Electroencephalographic (EEG) delta frequency has been associated with the activity of the dopaminergic brain reward system, which is crucial for nicotine induced effects, and decreases after nicotine admission in smokers. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate EEG delta power changes induced by hf rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in nicotine deprived smokers and it's relation to cue-induced nicotine craving. Methods Fourteen healthy smokers meeting ICD-10 criteria for tobacco addiction participated in this within-subject sham controlled study. Participants had to abstain from smoking 6~h before the experiment. Effects of high-frequency repetitive TMS (hf rTMS) (10~Hz) for verum (left DLPFC) and sham (vertex) stimulations on cue-induced nicotine craving and resting state EEG delta power were assessed before and three times within 40~min after rTMS. Results Both craving (P~=~0.046) and EEG delta power (P~=~0.048) were significantly lower after verum stimulation compared to sham stimulation across the whole post stimulation time period assessed. However, changes of craving ratings and delta power did not correlate. Conclusion Hf rTMS applied to the left DLPFC reduces nicotine craving in short-term abstinent smokers. Changes in delta activity support the idea that stimulation induced effects are mediated by the dopaminergic brain reward system, which presumably plays a prominent, but probably not exclusive, role in this stimulation induced behavioral modulation, making this method a promising smoking cessation treatment candidate.},

Identifying distinct functional and effective connectivity patterns in GAD may provide biomarkers for their diagnoses. This study aims to investigate the differences of features of brain network connectivity between GAD patients and healthy controls (HC), and to assess whether those differences can serve as biomarkers to distinguish GAD from controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was conducted on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 20 GAD patients with medicine-free and 20 matched HC, identifying nine highly reproducible and significantly different functional brain connectivity patterns across diagnostic groups. We then utilized Granger causality (GC) to study the effective connectivity between the regions that identified by HPM-ICA. The linear discriminant analysis was finally used to distinguish GAD from controls with these measures of neural connectivity. The GAD patients showed stronger functional connectivity in amygdala, insula, putamen, thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex, but weaker in frontal and temporal cortex compared with controls. Besides, the effective connectivity in GAD was decreased from the cortex to amygdala and basal ganglia. Applying the ICA and GC features to the classifier led to a classification accuracy of 87.5\%, with a sensitivity of 90.0\% and a specificity of 85.0\%. These findings suggest that the presence of emotion dysregulation circuits may contribute to the pathophysiology of GAD, and these aberrant brain features may serve as robust brain biomarkers for GAD.

However, it is not known whether there is a causal relationship between these phenomena. We found that in adult male Wistar rats, silencing the medial septum during recall did not affect avoidance memory expression or maintenance but abolished hPAC and the amnesia caused by the intrahippocampal administration of reconsolidation blockers, both of which were restored by concomitant theta burst stimulation of the fimbria\textendash fornix pathway. Remarkably, artificial hPAC generated by fimbria\textendash fornix stimulation during recall of a learned avoidance response naturally resistant to hippocampus-dependent reconsolidation made it susceptible to reactivation-dependent amnesia. Our results indicate that hPAC mediates the destabilization required for avoidance memory reconsolidation and suggest that the generation of artificial hPAC at recall overcomes the boundary conditions of this process. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Theta-gamma hippocampal phase-amplitude coupling (hPAC) increases during the induction of hippocampus-dependent avoidance memory reconsolidation. However, whether hPAC plays a causal role in this process remains unknown. Using behavioral, electrophysiological, optogenetic, and biochemical tools in adult male Wistar rats, we demonstrate that reactivation-induced hPAC is necessary for avoidance memory destabilization, and that artificial induction of this patterned activity during recall of reconsolidation-resistant aversive memories renders them liable to the amnesic effect of reconsolidation inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Reactivated memories can be modified during reconsolidation, making this process a potential therapeutic target for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental illness characterized by the recurring avoidance of situations that evoke trauma-related fears. However, avoidance memory reconsolidation depends on a set of still loosely defined boundary conditions, limiting the translational value of basic research. In particular, the involvement of the hippocampus in fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation remains controversial. Combining behavioral and electrophysiological analyses in male Wistar rats, we found that previous learning of relevant nonaversive information is essential to elicit the participation of the hippocampus in avoidance memory reconsolidation, which is associated with an increase in theta- and gamma-oscillation power and cross-frequency coupling in dorsal CA1 during reactivation of the avoidance response. Our results indicate that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when reactivation results in contradictory representations regarding the consequences of avoidance and suggest that robust nesting of hippocampal theta\textendash gamma rhythms at the time of retrieval is a specific reconsolidation marker. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by maladaptive avoidance responses to stimuli or behaviors that represent or bear resemblance to some aspect of a traumatic experience. Disruption of reconsolidation, the process by which reactivated memories become susceptible to modifications, is a promising approach for treating PTSD patients. However, much of what is known about fear-motivated avoidance memory reconsolidation derives from studies based on fear conditioning instead of avoidance-learning paradigms. Using a step-down inhibitory avoidance task in rats, we found that the hippocampus is involved in memory reconsolidation only when the animals acquired the avoidance response in an environment that they had previously learned as safe and showed that increased theta- and gamma-oscillation coupling during reactivation is an electrophysiological signature of this process.},

Two non-pyramidal cell types from animals as young as 8 days demonstrated clear, direct responses to application of cholinergic agonists. These cholinergic actions are excitatory, mostly blocked by muscarinic antagonists, and persist under conditions which block synaptic transmission (TTX, low Ca2+/high Mg2+). Cholinergic agonists may affect different conductances in interneurons than in PCs, sometimes resulting in rapid depolarization. Demonstration of direct excitatory cholinergic effects on inhibitory interneurons supports the view that cholinergically-evoked hyperpolarizations in PCs are due to local circuit interactions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Brain plasticity is dynamically regulated across the life span, peaking during windows of early life. Typically assessed in the physiological range of milliseconds (real time), these trajectories are also influenced on the longer timescales of developmental time (nurture) and evolutionary time (nature), which shape neural architectures that support plasticity. Properly sequenced critical periods of circuit refinement build up complex cognitive functions, such as language, from more primary modalities. Here, we consider recent progress in the biological basis of critical periods as a unifying rubric for understanding plasticity across multiple timescales. Notably, the maturation of parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory neurons is pivotal. These fast-spiking cells generate gamma oscillations associated with critical period plasticity, are sensitive to circadian gene manipulation, emerge at different rates across brain regions, acquire perineuronal nets with age, and may be influenced by epigenetic factors over generations. These features provide further novel insight into the impact of early adversity and neurodevelopmental risk factors for mental disorders.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These cells were also more active during threat-avoidance behaviors such as escape and freezing, even though these behaviors have antagonistic motor output. Conversely, the threat-approach ensemble was more active during risk-assessment behaviors and near threats. Furthermore, unsupervised methods showed approach/avoidance states were encoded with shared activity patterns across threats. Lastly, the relative number of cells in each ensemble predicted threat-avoidance across mice.

The results indicate that the lateral septal nucleus is divided into major rostral, caudal, and ventral parts that differ from the widely used cytoarchitectonic parcellation into dorsal, intermediate, and ventral parts. Furthermore, the rostral, caudal, and ventral parts are in turn divided into about 20 zones, regions, and domains on the basis of differential terminal fields and neurons that express particular neuropeptides and steroid hormone receptors. In general, the small zones and regions form dorsoventrally oriented sheets or bands that are arranged in a complex way.

  abstract = {The organization of lateral septal connections has been re-examined with respect to its newly defined subdivisions, using anterograde (PHAL) and retrograde (fluorogold) axonal tracer methods. The results confirm that progressively more ventral transverse bands in the hippocampus (defined by the orientation of the trisynaptic circuit) innervate progressively more ventral, transversely oriented sheets in the lateral septum. In addition, hippocampal field CA3 projects selectively to the caudal part of the lateral septal nucleus, which occupies topologically lateral regions of the transverse sheets, whereas field CA1 and the subiculum project selectively to the rostral and ventral parts of the lateral septal nucleus, which occupy topologically medial regions of the transverse sheets. Finally, the evidence suggests that progressively more ventral hippocampal bands innervate progressively thicker lateral septal sheets. In contrast, ascending inputs to the lateral septum appear to define at least 20 vertically oriented bands or subdivisions arranged orthogonal to the hippocampal input (Risold, P.Y. and Swanson, L.W., Chemoarchitecture of the rat lateral septal nucleus, Brain Res. Rev., 24 (1997) 91\textendash 113). Hypothalamic nuclei forming parts of behavior-specific subsystems share bidirectional connections with specific subdivisions of the lateral septal nucleus (especially the rostral part), suggesting that specific domains in the hippocampus may influence specific hypothalamic behavioral systems. In contrast, the caudal part of the lateral septal nuceus projects to the lateral hypothalamus and to the supramammillary nucleus, which projects back to the hippocampus and receives its major inputs from brainstem cell groups thought to regulate behavioral state. The neural system mediating defensive behavior shows these features rather clearly, and what is known about its organization is discussed in some detail.},

The MS-DBB contains cholinergic, GABAergic, and recently described glutamatergic neurons, but their specific contribution to theta generation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm using optogenetic activation and electrophysiological recordings performed in in vitro preparations and in freely behaving mice. The experiments in slices suggest that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons provide prominent excitatory inputs to a majority of local GABAergic and a minority of septal cholinergic neurons. In contrast, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic fiber terminals in hippocampal slices elicited weak postsynaptic responses in hippocampal neurons. In the in vitro septo-hippocampal preparation, activation of MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons did increase the rhythmicity of hippocampal theta oscillations, whereas stimulation of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic fibers in the fornix did not have an effect. In freely behaving mice, activation of these neurons in the MS-DBB strongly synchronized hippocampal theta rhythms over a wide range of frequencies, whereas activation of their projections to the hippocampus through fornix stimulations had no effect on theta rhythms, suggesting that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons played a role in theta generation through local modulation of septal neurons. Together, these results provide the first evidence that MS-DBB glutamatergic neurons modulate local septal circuits, which in turn contribute to theta rhythms in the hippocampus. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current paper explores the functional role of septal glutamatergic neurons, a recently identified population, in theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus. Using optogenetics and electrophysiology, we have explored the functional connectivity of these neurons in vitro, as well as their influence on theta rhythms both in vitro and in vivo, and show that this neuronal population can powerfully drive theta rhythms through intraseptal connections. These results strongly suggest a role of glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm generation and may therefore be important for learning and memory.},

We investigated the mechanisms responsible for higher nociceptive thresholds in red-haired mice resulting from a loss of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) function and found that the increased thresholds are melanocyte dependent but melanin independent. MC1R loss of function decreases melanocytic proopiomelanocortin transcription and systemic melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) levels in the plasma of red-haired (Mc1re/e) mice. Decreased peripheral {$\alpha$}-MSH derepresses the central opioid tone mediated by the opioid receptor OPRM1, resulting in increased nociceptive thresholds. We identified MC4R as the MSH-responsive receptor that opposes OPRM1 signaling and the periaqueductal gray area in the brainstem as a central area of opioid/melanocortin antagonism. This work highlights the physiologic role of melanocytic MC1R and circulating melanocortins in the regulation of nociception and provides a mechanistic framework for altered opioid signaling and pain sensitivity in red-haired individuals. In the red-haired background, altered pain thresholds exist and are explained by distinct OPRM1/MC4R signaling.

Both GABAergic and cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) have been associated with spatial memory, but the relationship between the two neuronal populations is not fully understood. The present study investigated the effect of selective GABAergic MSDB lesions on hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) efflux and spatial memory during tasks that varied in memory demand. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given GABAergic lesions of the MSDB using GAT1-saporin (GAT1-SAP) and examined on spontaneous exploration (Experiment 1) and non-matching to position without (NMTP; Experiment 2) and with a delay (DNMTP; Experiment 3), while concurrently using in vivo microdialysis to measure hippocampal ACh efflux. Intraseptal GAT1-SAP treatment did not alter baseline or behaviorally stimulated hippocampal ACh efflux or maze exploration (Experiment 1). Moreover, GAT1-SAP did not alter evoked hippocampal ACh efflux related to NMTP nor did it impair working memory in NMTP (Experiment 2). In contrast, both ACh efflux and performance in DNMTP were impaired by intraseptal GAT1-SAP. Thus, GABAergic MSDB neurons are important for spatial working memory and modulate hippocampal ACh efflux under conditions of high memory load. The relationship between the septohippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic systems and working memory will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling through CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) regulates autonomic, endocrine and behavioral responses to stress and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders including anxiety, depression, and addiction. Using a validated CRFR1 reporter mouse line (bacterial artificial chromosome identified by green fluorescence protein (BAC GFP-CRFR1)), we investigated the distribution of CRFR1 in the developing mouse forebrain. Distribution of CRFR1 was investigated at postnatal days (P) 0, 4, and 21 in male and female mice. CRFR1 increased with age in several regions including the medial amygdala, arcuate nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamus, medial septum, CA1 hippocampal area, and the lateral habenula. Regions showing decreased CRFR1 expression with increased age include the intermediate portion of the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and CA3 hippocampal area. We report a sexually dimorphic expression of CRFR1 within the rostral portion of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (AVPV/PeN), a region known to regulate ovulation, reproductive and maternal behaviors. Females had a greater number of CRFR1-GFP-ir cells at all time points in the AVPV/PeN and CRFR1-GFP-ir was nearly absent in males by P21. Overall, alterations in CRFR1-GFP-ir distribution based on age and sex may contribute to observed age- and sex-dependent differences in stress regulation.},

In the primary visual cortex, the selectivity of a neuron in layer~2/3 for stimulus orientation and direction is thought to arise from intracortical inputs that are similarly selective1\textendash 8. However, the excitatory inputs of a neuron can have diverse stimulus preferences1\textendash 4,6,7,9, and inhibitory inputs can be promiscuous10 and unselective11. Here we show that the excitatory and inhibitory intracortical connections to a layer~2/3 neuron accord with its selectivity by obeying precise spatial patterns. We used rabies tracing1,12 to label and functionally image the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to individual pyramidal neurons of layer~2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. Presynaptic excitatory neurons spanned layers 2/3 and 4 and were distributed coaxial to the preferred orientation of the postsynaptic neuron, favouring the region opposite to its preferred direction. By contrast, presynaptic inhibitory neurons resided within layer~2/3 and favoured locations near the postsynaptic neuron and ahead of its preferred direction. The direction selectivity of a postsynaptic neuron was unrelated to the selectivity of presynaptic neurons, but correlated with the spatial displacement between excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic ensembles. Similar asymmetric connectivity establishes direction selectivity in the retina13\textendash 17. This suggests that this circuit motif might be canonical in sensory processing.},

One possible role of oscillatory activity is to assure the maintenance of information in working memory (WM).

Specifically, we propose that gamma-band oscillations are generically involved in the maintenance of WM information. By contrast, alpha-band activity reflects the active inhibition of task-irrelevant information, whereas theta-band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items. Finally, we address the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in enabling alpha\textendash gamma and theta\textendash gamma codes for distinct WM information.},

Prominent inputs arise in the amygdaloid complex, restricted areas of the cerebral cortex, parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus, and nuclei of the lower brainstem. Autoradiographic tracing experiments indicate that the amygdaloid fibers are distributed throughout the NHDB and the NBM, and to a lesser extent to the ventral pallidum. Relatively few fibers innervate the more medially located nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band (NVDB) and the medial septal nucleus. Visualization of the amygdalofugal fibers with the tracer PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris leuco-agglutinin) shows that they have varicosities resembling boutons en passant along their length in the substantia innominata. Retrograde tracing experiments using WGA-HRP indicate that the cells of origin of the projection from the amygdala are concentrated in the parvicellular basal nucleus, the caudal part of the magnocellular basal nucleus, the magnocellular accessory basal nucleus, and the central nucleus. Relatively few fibers to the substantia innominata arise in the rostrodorsal part of the magnocellular basal nucleus, or in the lateral or parvicellular accessory basal nuclei. Cortical cells projecting to the substantia innominata were retrogradely labeled in the orbitofrontal cortex (including areas 11\textendash 14 and 25), the rostral insula (especially the agranular area), the rostroventral temporal cortex (including areas 35, 36, and parts of TG and TE), and the piriform and entorhinal cortices. The projections from the orbital and rostral temporal cortex were confirmed with anterograde tracers. Projections to the substantia innominata were not found from the more lateral, dorsal or caudal parts of the cerebral cortex, although fibers from temporal area TA may pass through the dendritic field of the most caudal cells of the NBM. Diencephalic cells projecting to the substantia innominata are distributed diffusely throughout the preoptic area and hypothalamus, with higher concentration in the lateral preoptic area and in the pre-, supra-, and tuberomammillary nuclei. Cells are also found in the midline thalamic nuclei and in the region between the peripeduncular and subparafascicular nuclei. In the brainstem, high concentrations of cells projecting to the substantia innominata are located in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, the parabrachial nuclei, and the ventral tegmental area and pars compacta of the substantia nigra. There are also cells in the central gray and pedunculopontine region, the reticular formation, the locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The medial septum implements cortical theta oscillations, a 5-12 Hz rhythm associated with locomotion and paradoxical sleep, reflecting synchronization of neuronal assemblies e.g. place cell sequence coding. Highly rhythmic burst-firing parvalbumin-positive GABAergic medial septal neurons are strongly coupled to theta oscillations and target cortical GABAergic interneurons, contributing to coordination within one or several cortical regions. However, a large population of medial septal neurons of unidentified neurotransmitter phenotype and with unknown axonal target areas fire with a low degree of rhythmicity. We investigated whether low-rhythmic firing neurons (LRNs) innervated similar or different cortical regions to high-rhythmic neurons (HRNs) and assessed their temporal dynamics in awake male mice. The majority of LRNs were GABAergic and parvalbumin-immunonegative, some expressing calbindin; they innervated interneurons mostly in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. Individual LRNs showed several distinct firing patterns during immobility and locomotion, forming a parallel inhibitory stream for the modulation of cortical interneurons. Despite their fluctuating firing rates, the preferred firing phase of LRNs during theta oscillations matched the highest firing probability phase of principal cells in the DG and CA3. In addition, as a population, LRNs were markedly suppressed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, had a low burst incidence, and several of them did not fire on all theta cycles. Thus, CA3 receives GABAergic input from both HRNs and LRNs, but the DG receives mainly LRN input. We propose that distinct GABAergic LRNs contribute to changing the excitability of the DG and CA3 during memory discrimination via transient disinhibition of principal cells.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}\textbf{SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT}{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For the encoding and recall of episodic memories, nerve cells in the cerebral cortex are activated in precisely timed sequences. Rhythmicity facilitates the coordination of neuronal activity, and these rhythms are detected as oscillations of different frequencies, such as 5-12 Hz theta oscillations. Degradation of these rhythms, e.g. through neurodegeneration, causes memory deficits. The medial septum, a part of the basal forebrain that innervates the hippocampal formation, contains high-rhythmic and low-rhythmic firing neurons, which may contribute differentially to cortical neuronal coordination. We discovered that GABAergic low-rhythmic neurons preferentially innervate the dentate gyrus and the CA3 area of the hippocampus, regions important for episodic memory. These neurons act in parallel with the high-rhythmic neurons, mostly via transient inhibition of inhibitory neurons.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study we describe a previously uncharacterized projection from the septum to the NI, which may provide feedback modulation of the ascending circuitry. Fluorogold injections into the NI resulted in retrograde labeling in the septum that was concentrated in the horizontal diagonal band and areas of the posterior septum including the septofimbrial and triangular septal nuclei. Double-immunofluorescent staining indicated that the majority of NI-projecting septal neurons were calretinin-positive and some were parvalbumin-, calbindin-, or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-67-positive. Choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons were Fluorogold-negative. Injection of anterograde tracers into medial septum, or triangular septal and septofimbrial nuclei, revealed fibers descending to the supramammillary nucleus, median raphe, and the NI. These anterogradely labeled varicosities displayed synaptophysin immunoreactivity, indicating septal inputs form synapses on NI neurons. Anterograde tracer also colocalized with GAD-67-positive puncta in labeled fibers, which in some cases made close synaptic contact with GAD-67-labeled NI neurons. These data provide evidence for the existence of an inhibitory descending projection from medial and posterior septum to the NI that provides a 'feedback loop' to modulate the comparatively more dense ascending NI projections to medial septum and hippocampus. Neural processes and associated behaviors activated or modulated by changes in hippocampal theta rhythm may depend on reciprocal connections between ascending and descending pathways rather than on unidirectional regulation via the medial septum.

  abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band region, which participates in learning and memory processes via its cholinergic and GABAergic projection to the hippocampus, is one of the structures affected by beta amyloid (betaA) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The acute effects of betaA (25-35 and 1-40) on action potential generation and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in slices of the medial septal area of the rat brain were studied using current and patch-clamp techniques. The betaA mechanism of action through M1 muscarinic receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels was also addressed. Excitatory evoked responses decreased (30-60\%) in amplitude after betaA (2 microM) perfusion in 70\% of recorded cells. However, the firing properties were unaltered at the same concentration. This depression was irreversible in most cases, and was not prevented or reversed by nicotine (5 microM). In addition, the results obtained using a paired-pulse protocol support pre- and postsynaptic actions of the peptide. The betaA effect was blocked by calcicludine (50 nM), a selective antagonist of L-type calcium channels, and also by blocking muscarinic receptors with atropine (5 muM) or pirenzepine (1 microM), a more specific M1-receptor blocker. We show that in the medial septal area this oligomeric peptide acts through calcium channels and muscarinic receptors. As blocking any of these pathways blocks the betaA effects, we propose a joint action through both mechanisms. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology at the onset of AD. This understanding will be required for the development of new therapeutic agents.},

  abstract = {The efferent connections of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) have been analyzed in a series of 30 rat brains with injections of 3H-amino acids into different parts of the area and the surrounding regions. Our findings indicate that all parts of the LHA contribute ascending and descending fibers to the medial forebrain bundle, and also project medially to certain of the adjoining hypothalamic nuclei. All levels of the LHA appear to send some fibers to a continuous group of structures that extends from the medial septal-diagonal band complex rostrally, through the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas to the mammillary complex and the ventral tegmental area caudally. In addition, it is evident that cells at different levels within the LHA may have differential projections. Thus, the anterior and lateral parts of the LHA also appear to project substantially to the anterior hypothalamic area, the ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, the parataenial and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, and the medial part of the lateral habenular nucleus. Similarly, cells in the tuberal and posterior parts of the LHA project to the central gray, the longest projections from the posterior region reaching as far caudally as the central tegmental field, the parabrachial nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the superior central and dorsal nuclei of the raphe. Viewed as a whole, the LHA is therefore well-suited to integrate inputs from the limbic system and brainstem and to relay them on the one hand to the medial zone of the hypothalamus and on the other to virtually every structure closely associated with the medical forebrain bundle and to the nuclei of origin of the major ascending monoaminergic systems.},

In large-scale population recordings, the orthogonal nature of hippocampal representations across environments is evident in the complete reorganization of the firing locations of hippocampal place cells. Entorhinal grid cells provide inputs to the hippocampus, and their firing patterns shift relative to each other across different environments. Although this suggests that altered grid cell firing could generate distinct hippocampal population codes, it has recently been shown that new and distinct hippocampal place fields emerge while grid cell firing is compromised.

These models showed amyloid peptide (A{$\beta$}) pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in an age-dependent manner. The former line exhibits extensive pathology as early as 6 months but is unsuitable for investigating A{$\beta$} metabolism and clearance because the Arctic mutation renders A{$\beta$} resistant to proteolytic degradation and prone to aggregation. In particular, it is inapplicable to preclinical immunotherapy studies due to its discrete affinity for anti-A{$\beta$} antibodies. The weakness of the latter model is that it may take as long as 18 months for the pathology to become prominent. We have thus generated a new model that exhibits early deposition of wild-type human A{$\beta$} by crossbreeding the App\textsuperscript{NL-F} line with the Psen1\textsuperscript{P117L/WT} line. We show that the effects of the pathogenic mutations in the App and Psen1 genes are additive or synergistic.

If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions?

  abstract = {How to model hallucinations in mice There has not been enough progress in our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying psychosis. Studying psychotic disorders in animal models is difficult because the diagnosis relies on self-reported symptoms that can only be assessed in humans. Schmack et al. developed a paradigm to probe and rigorously measure experimentally controlled hallucinations in rodents (see the Perspective by Matamales). Using dopamine-sensor measurements and circuit and pharmacological manipulations, they demonstrated a brain circuit link between excessive dopamine and hallucination-like experience. This could potentially be useful as a translational model of common psychotic symptoms described in various psychiatric disorders. It may also help in the development of new therapeutic approaches based on anatomically selective modulation of dopamine function. Science, this issue p. eabf4740; see also p. 33 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONPsychotic disorders such as schizophrenia impose enormous human, social, and economic burdens. The prognosis of psychotic disorders has not substantially improved over the past decades because our understanding of the underlying neurobiology has remained stagnant. Indeed, the subjective nature of hallucinations, a defining symptom of psychosis, presents an enduring challenge for their rigorous study in humans and translation to preclinical animal models. Here, we developed a cross-species computational psychiatry approach to directly relate human and rodent behavior and used this approach to study the neural basis of hallucination-like perception in mice. RATIONALEHallucinations are false percepts that are experienced with the same subjective confidence as ``true'' percepts. Similar false percepts can be quantitatively evaluated using a sensory detection task in which individuals report whether they heard a signal embedded in a background noise and indicate how confident they are about their answer. Thus, we defined hallucination-like percepts as confident false alarms\textemdash that is, incorrect reports that a signal was present, which are reported with high confidence. We reasoned that such experimentally controlled hallucination-like percepts engage neural mechanisms shared with spontaneously experienced hallucinations in psychosis and can therefore serve as a translational model of psychotic symptoms. Because psychotic symptoms are thought to involve increased dopamine transmission in the striatum, we hypothesized that hallucination-like perception is mediated by increased striatal dopamine. RESULTSWe set up analogous auditory detection tasks for humans and mice. Both humans and mice were presented with an auditory stimulus in which a tone signal was embedded in a noisy background on half of the trials. Humans pressed one of two buttons to report whether or not they heard a signal, whereas mice poked into one of two choice ports. Humans indicated how confident they were in their report by positioning a cursor on a slider; mice expressed their confidence by investing variable time durations to earn a reward. In humans, hallucination-like percepts\textemdash high-confidence false alarms\textemdash were correlated with the tendency to experience spontaneous hallucinations, as quantified by a self-report questionnaire. In mice, hallucination-like percepts increased with two manipulations known to induce hallucinations in humans: administration of ketamine and the heightened expectation of hearing a signal. We then used genetically encoded dopamine sensors with fiber photometry to monitor dopamine dynamics in the striatum. We found that elevations in dopamine levels before stimulus onset predicted hallucination-like perception in both the ventral striatum and the tail of the striatum. We devised a computational model that explains the emergence of hallucination-like percepts as a consequence of faulty perceptual inference when prior expectations outweigh sensory evidence. Our model clarified how hallucination-like percepts can arise from fluctuations in two distinct types of expectations: reward expectations and perceptual expectations. In mice, dopamine fluctuations in the ventral striatum reflected reward expectations, whereas in the tail of the striatum they resembled perceptual expectations. We optogenetically boosted dopamine in the tail of the striatum and observed that increasing dopamine induced hallucination-like perception. This effect was rescued by the administration of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that blocks D2 dopamine receptors. CONCLUSIONWe established hallucination-like perception as a quantitative behavior in mice for modeling the subjective experience of a cardinal symptom of psychosis. We found that hallucination-like perception is mediated by dopamine elevations in the striatum and that this can be explained by encoding different kinds of expectations in distinct striatal subregions. These findings support the idea that hallucinations arise as faulty perceptual inferences due to elevated dopamine producing a bias in favor of prior expectations against current sensory evidence. Our results also yield circuit-level insights into the long-standing dopamine hypothesis of psychosis and provide a rigorous framework for dissecting the neural circuit mechanisms involved in hallucinations. We propose that this approach can guide the development of novel treatments for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6537/eabf4740/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Hallucination-like perception framework and striatal dopamine.In humans and mice, a computational-behavioral task models hallucinations as high-confidence false percepts. In humans, such hallucination-like percepts are correlated with self-reported hallucinations. In mice, hallucination-like percepts are mediated by striatal dopamine. Data are means {$\pm$} SEM. *P {$<$} 0.05, **P {$<$} 0.01. Hallucinations, a central symptom of psychotic disorders, are attributed to excessive dopamine in the brain. However, the neural circuit mechanisms by which dopamine produces hallucinations remain elusive, largely because hallucinations have been challenging to study in model organisms. We developed a task to quantify hallucination-like perception in mice. Hallucination-like percepts, defined as high-confidence false detections, increased after hallucination-related manipulations in mice and correlated with self-reported hallucinations in humans. Hallucination-like percepts were preceded by elevated striatal dopamine levels, could be induced by optogenetic stimulation of mesostriatal dopamine neurons, and could be reversed by the antipsychotic drug haloperidol. These findings reveal a causal role for dopamine-dependent striatal circuits in hallucination-like perception and open new avenues to develop circuit-based treatments for psychotic disorders. A mouse behavioral model of hallucinations yields circuit-level insights into the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis.

CA1 pyramidal cells were phase-locked mainly to fast gamma ({$>$}100~Hz) LFP patterns restricted to CA1, which were strongest at the theta trough. While theta phase coordination of spiking across entorhinal-hippocampal regions depended on memory demands, LFP gamma patterns below 100~Hz in the hippocampus were consistently layer specific and largely reflected afferent activity. Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies.},

Transgenic Tg4510 mice model the tauopathy of the disease, with these mice exhibiting progressive, region-specific neuronal loss, and behavioral deficits. In the present study, neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of 7-month-old Tg4510 mice was investigated and compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Multisite field potentials were recorded using 16-site silicon probes, inserted across the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized mice. The hippocampal network theta oscillation was evaluated in these mice by stimulating the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis. Subsequently, population spikes in the dentate gyrus were identified in response to perforant path stimulation, and long-term potentiation was elicited by theta burst stimulation. Tg4510 mice showed dramatically reduced dentate gyrus population spike amplitude; however, the magnitude of theta burst stimulation-induced long-term potentiation was identical in WT and transgenic mice. WT and Tg4510 mice showed identical increase in frequency to nucleus pontis oralis stimulation, whereas absolute theta power was severely reduced in the Tg4510 animals. Because total signal power over the entire frequency band range was reduced, there was no difference in relative theta power between WT and Tg4510 mice. These presently described electrophysiological findings can be directly attributed to the drastic reduction of pyramidal/granule neurons in Tg4510 mice, which could be the main contributing factor to their impaired behavior and cognitive function. However, the remaining synapses and neuronal circuitry seem to function properly in these assays.},

  abstract = {Objective High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have shown promising utility in the spatial localization of the seizure onset zone for patients with focal refractory epilepsy. Comparatively few studies have addressed potential temporal variations in HFOs, or their role in the preictal period. Here, we introduce a novel evaluation of the instantaneous HFO rate through interictal and peri-ictal epochs to assess their usefulness in identifying imminent seizure onset. Methods Utilizing an automated HFO detector, we analyzed intracranial electroencephalographic data from 30 patients with refractory epilepsy undergoing long-term presurgical evaluation. We evaluated HFO rates both as a 30-minute average and as a continuous function of time and used nonparametric statistical methods to compare individual and population-level differences in rate during peri-ictal and interictal periods. Results Mean HFO rate was significantly higher for all epochs in seizure onset zone channels versus other channels. Across the 30 patients of our cohort, we found no statistically significant differences in mean HFO rate during preictal and interictal epochs. For continuous HFO rates in seizure onset zone channels, however, we found significant population-wide increases in preictal trends relative to interictal periods. Using a data-driven analysis, we identified a subset of 11 patients in whom either preictal HFO rates or their continuous trends were significantly increased relative to those of interictal baseline and the rest of the population. Significance These results corroborate existing findings that HFO rates within epileptic tissue are higher during interictal periods. We show this finding is also present in preictal, ictal, and postictal data, and identify a novel biomarker of preictal state: an upward trend in HFO rate leading into seizures in some patients. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence that HFOs can function as a temporal biomarker of seizure onset.},

Responses of the cells to electrical stimulation of the raphe nuclei and nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) were measured. 2. LC stimulation caused a long latency, 30-100 msec, and long duration, 100-300 msec cessation of spontaneous activity of most recorded neurones. When bursting-type neurones were recorded, the stimulation occasionally caused a synchronized repetitive bursting firing pattern. 3. Pre-treatment with drugs which interfere with catecholamine neurotransmission, i.e. reserpine and 6OHDA, prevented the appearance of cellular responses to LC stimulation. 4. Stimulation of the dorsal or the median raphe nuclei generated more complex and less clear-cut responses. These included several types of long (20-50 msec) and short (2-5 msec) latency responses. These responses were also accompanied in some cells by synchronized repetitive bursting. 5. Interference with serotonin neurotransmission with PPCA or reserpine reduced the detection of long latency responses. 6. Short latency responses accompanied by evoked field potentials were recorded also after stimulation of dorsal tegmental nucleus. 7. Rates of spontaneous firing cells were augmented after monoamine neurotransmission interruption whereas after fornix lesion, when there is supposedly an increased monoamine innervation of the septum, cells fire at lower rates than normal. 8. It is suggested that noradrenaline and serotonin may serve as neurotransmitters in the medial-septum-diagonal band areas.},

ACh but not cyclic GMP produced a short-latency hyperpolarization associated with a decrease in input resistance. This was followed by a long-latency but long duration depolarization associated in some cells with an increase in input resistance. This change in resistance followed the depolarization and outlasted it by 5\textendash 20min, until complete recovery. During the depolarization there was a reduction in magnitude of EPSPs produced by activation of the Schaffer collateral excitatory afferents. The reversal potential for the hyperpolarization was about \textemdash 95 mV, and it was blocked by 4-aminopyridine. The depolarization, but not the hyperpolarization was markedly attenuated in slices maintained in low (25\textdegree C) temperature. The responses to ACh were blocked by atropine but not byd-tubocurarine. The hyperpolarization as well as the depolarization were present in slices treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX)., but were reduced in slices superfused with a low Ca2+-high Mg2+ medium, and in slices treated with Mn2+ and Co2+ ions. It is suggested that ACh causes a fast increase in gK+, followed by along-lasting energy-dependent depolarization associated with action potential discharges, a decrease in conductance and a suppression of EPSPs.},

WGA-HRP injections into the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and the magnocellular preoptic area (MgPA) retrogradely labelled many neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, dorsal raphe nucleus, and ventral tegmental area. Areas with moderate numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons included the median raphe nucleus, and area lateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the pons, the locus ceruleus, and the medial parabrachial nucleus. A few labelled neurons were seen in the substantia nigra pars compacta, mesencephalic and pontine reticular formation, a midline area in the pontine central gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, raphe magnus, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, and ventrolateral medulla. A similar but not identical distribution of labelled neurons was seen following WGA-HRP injections into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. The possible neurotransmitter content of some of these afferents to the HDB/MgPA was examined by combining retrograde Fluoro-Gold labelling and immunofluorescence. In the mesopontine tegmentum, many retrogradely labelled neurons were immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase. In the dorsal raphe nucleus, some retrogradely labelled neurons were positive for serotonin and some for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH); however, the majority of retrogradely labelled neurons in this region were not immunoreactive for either marker. The ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and locus ceruleus contained retrogradely labelled neurons which were also immunoreactive for TH. Of the retrogradely labelled neurons occasionally observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract, prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and ventrolateral medulla, some were immunoreactive for either TH or phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. To characterize functionally some of these brainstem afferents, extracellular recordings were made from antidromically identified cortically projecting neurons, mostly located in the HDB and MgPA. In agreement with most previous studies, about half (48\%) of these neurons were spontaneously active. Electrical stimulation in the vicinity of the pedunculopontine tegmerital and dorsal raphe nuclei elicited either excitatory or inhibitory responses in 21\% (13/62) of the cortically projecting neurons. These findings indicate that neurons in the magnocellular basal fore-brain receive afferents from widely distributed brainstem neurons that contain acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and some unknown neurotransmitters. Through their actions on magnocellular basal forebrain neurons, these brainstem neurons may indirectly regulate the activity of neurons throughout the cerebral cortex.},

The BF also contains non-cholinergic neurons, including {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons which co-distribute and co-project with the cholinergic neurons. Both types of neuron project, in variable proportions, to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb, whereas descending projections to the posterior hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei are predominantly non-cholinergic. Some of the cholinergic and non-cholinergic projection neurons contain neuropeptides such as galanin, nitric oxide synthase, and possibly glutamate. To understand better the function of the BF, the organization of the multiple ascending and descending projections of BF neurons is reviewed along with their neurochemical heterogeneity, and possible functions of individual pathways are discussed. It is proposed that BF neurons belong to multiple systems with distinct cognitive, motivational, emotional, motor, and regulatory functions, and that through these pathways, the BF plays a role in controlling both cognitive and non-cognitive aspects of vigilance.},

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important for mediating and executing these functions. Functional neuroimaging and molecular studies have consistently shown PFC abnormalities in ScZ. In addition, recent studies have suggested that impairments in oscillatory activity, especially in the gamma band (approximately 30\textendash 80 Hz), reflect disturbed cortical information processing in this patient group. Here we review evidence that dysfunctional gamma-band responses (GBR) in the PFC could be a factor contributing to WM and other cognitive deficits in ScZ. We provide an overview of noninvasive electrophysiological studies reporting frontal GBR abnormalities in ScZ patients during WM and other cognitive tasks. In agreement with the often-reported hypofrontality in functional neuroimaging studies, the majority of reviewed studies revealed reduced amplitudes or reduced phase locking of GBR over frontal areas in this patient group. Clinical implications derived from these findings and possibilities to foster future studies on GBR abnormalities in ScZ patients, are discussed. Since oscillatory activity in the gamma band has previously been linked to a variety of neurotransmitters, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic system, the study of prefrontal GBR could also have implications for pharmacologic approaches in the treatment of WM and other cognitive deficits in ScZ.},

We also sought to determine whether the efferents from different regions within the prelimbic division were organized topographically. Anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used to examined the efferent projections from restricted injection sites within the mPFC. Major targets of the prelimbic area were found to include prefrontal, cingulate, and perirhinal cortical structures, the dorsomedial and ventral striatum, basal forebrain nuclei, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, mediodorsal, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray region, ventral midbrain tegmentum, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and raphe nuclei. Previously unreported projections of the prelimbic region were also observed, including efferents to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, and the pedunculopontine tegmental-cuneiform region. A topographical organization governed the efferent projections from the prelimbic area, such that the position of terminal fields within target structures was determined by the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral placement of the injection sites. Efferent projections from the medial precentral and dorsal anterior cingulate divisions (dorsomedial PFC) were organized in a similar topographical fashion and produced a pattern of anterograde labeling different from that seen with prelimbic injection sites. Target structures innervated primarily by the dorsomedial PFC included certain neocortical fields (the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices), the dorsolateral striatum, superior colliculus, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and the pontine and medullary reticular formation. Previously unreported projections to the paraoculomotor central gray area and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were observed following dorsomedial PFC injections. These results indicate that the efferent projections of the mPFC are topographically organized within and across the cytoarchitectonic divisions of the medial wall cortex. The significance of topographically organized and restricted projections of the rat mPFC is discussed in light of behavioral and physiological studies indicating functional heterogeneity of this region.},

To address this issue, we examined the spatial coding characteristics of hippocampal neurons in mice and rats navigating in different environments. We found that CA1 place cells located in the superficial sublayer were more active in cue-poor environments and preferentially used a firing rate code driven by intra-hippocampal inputs. In contrast, place cells located in the deep sublayer were more active in cue-rich environments and used a phase code driven by entorhinal inputs. Switching between these two spatial coding modes was supported by the interaction between excitatory gamma inputs and local inhibition.},

  abstract = {Most research on focal epilepsy focuses on mechanisms of seizure generation in the primary epileptic focus (EF). However, neurological deficits that are not directly linked to seizure activity and that may persist after focus removal are frequent. The recruitment of remote brain regions of an epileptic network (EN) is recognized as a possible cause, but a profound lack of experimental evidence exists concerning their recruitment and the type of pathological activities they exhibit. We studied the development of epileptic activities at the large-scale in male mice of the kainate model of unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy using high-density surface EEG and multiple-site intracortical recordings. We show that, along with focal spikes and fast ripples that remain localized to the injected hippocampus (i.e., the EF), a subpopulation of spikes that propagate across the brain progressively emerges even before the expression of seizures. The spatiotemporal propagation of these generalized spikes (GSs) is highly stable within and across animals, defining a large-scale EN comprising both hippocampal regions and frontal cortices. Interestingly, GSs are often concomitant with muscular twitches. In addition, while fast ripples are, as expected, highly frequent in the EF, they also emerge in remote cortical regions and in particular in frontal regions where GSs propagate. Finally, we demonstrate that these remote interictal activities are dependent on the focus in the early phase of the disease but continue to be expressed after focus silencing at later stages. Our results provide evidence that neuronal networks outside the initial focus are progressively altered during epileptogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT It has long been held that the epileptic focus is responsible for triggering seizures and driving interictal activities. However, focal epilepsies are associated with heterogeneous symptoms, calling into question the concept of a strictly focal disease. Using the mouse model of hippocampal sclerosis, this work demonstrates that focal epilepsy leads to the development of pathological activities specific to the epileptic condition, notably fast ripples, that appear outside of the primary epileptic focus. Whereas these activities are dependent on the focus early in the disease, focus silencing fails to control them in the chronic stage. Thus, dynamical changes specific to the epileptic condition are built up outside of the epileptic focus along with disease progression, which provides supporting evidence for network alterations in focal epilepsy.},

A variable proportion of patients experience decline in benefit over time, however, most studies have not been designed to describe the phenomenon of waning benefit in terms that are helpful for patient counseling. In this retrospective single center study, we define waning benefit as a phenomenon that occurs after patients begin to require reprogramming visits to optimize DBS benefit on tremor. We employed a survival analysis with time to escape (TTE) as a quantitative measure of time elapsed between implantation and the need for subsequent reprogramming. In our cohort of ET patients operated on with Vim DBS from 1994 to 2009, among 45 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 73\% reported waning benefit at some point during a mean follow-up period of 56 months (range 12\textendash 152 months). The mean TTE from implantation date was 18 months (range 3\textendash 75 months). We conclude that loss of benefit over time from Vim DBS for ET is more prevalent than previously published estimates have indicated and should be discussed during patient counseling regarding durability of expected benefit. In addition, this data suggests that a disease-based explanation rather than technical factors are more likely to explain the decline in benefit.},

Here, we designed a hippocampus-dependent task in which rats prospectively increased their reward-seeking behavior over a duration of minutes. During this timing behavior, hippocampal and striatal neurons represented successive time points on the order of minutes by gradually changing their firing rates and transiently increasing their firing rates at specific time points. These minute-encoding patterns progressively developed as the rats learned a time-reward relationship, and the patterns underwent flexible scaling in parallel with timing behavior. These observations suggest a neuronal basis in the hippocampal-striatal circuits that enables temporal processing and formation of episodic memory on a timescale of minutes.},

However, little is known about the reorganization of the temporal representation of time cells during changes in temporal structures of episodes. We investigated CA1 neuronal activity during temporal bisection tasks, in which the sets of time intervals to be discriminated were designed to be extended or contracted across the blocks of trials. Assemblies of neurons encoded elapsed time during the interval, and the representation was scaled when the set of interval times was varied. Theta phase precession and theta sequences of time cells were also scalable, and the fine temporal relationships were preserved between pairs in theta cycles. Moreover, theta sequences reflected the rats' decisions on the basis of their time estimation. These findings demonstrate that scalable features of time cells may support the capability of flexible temporal representation for memory formation. Temporal information represented in the hippocampus is scalable. Temporal information represented in the hippocampus is scalable.},

Here we use fluorescent glutamate and GABA sensors in an awake rodent model of neocortical seizures to resolve the spatiotemporal evolution of both neurotransmitters in the extracellular space. Interictal spikes are accompanied by brief glutamate transients which are maximal at the initiation site and rapidly propagate centrifugally. GABA transients last longer than glutamate transients and are maximal \textasciitilde 1.5 mm from the focus where they propagate centripetally. At the transition to seizures, GABA transients are attenuated, whilst glutamate transients increase in spatial extent.

Although attenuated theta rhythms have been observed in human subjects with increased anxiety, no study has been done on the possible physiological link between these two manifestations. We found that the mutant mouse for phospholipase C {$\beta$}4 (PLC-{$\beta$}4-/-) showed attenuated theta rhythm and increased anxiety, presenting the first animal model for the human condition. PLC-{$\beta$}4 is abundantly expressed in the medial septum, a region implicated in anxiety behavior. RNA interference-mediated PLC-{$\beta$}4 knockdown in the medial septum produced a phenotype similar to that of PLC-{$\beta$}4-/- mice. Furthermore, increasing cholinergic signaling by administering an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor cured the anomalies in both cholinergic theta rhythm and anxiety behavior observed in PLC-{$\beta$}4-/- mice. These findings suggest that (1) PLC-{$\beta$}4 in the medial septum is involved in controlling cholinergic theta oscillation and (2) cholinergic theta rhythm plays a critical role in suppressing anxiety. We propose that defining the cholinergic theta rhythm profile may provide guidance in subtyping anxiety disorders in humans for more effective diagnosis and treatments.},

We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin-2{$\alpha$} is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage-gated A-type K+ channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin-2{$\alpha$} spots, is not associated with the nectin-binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120-catenin and {$\beta$}-catenin. We showed here that nectin-2{$\alpha$} was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of nectin-2 reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin-2{$\alpha$} was associated with afadin, cadherin-8, p120-catenin, {$\beta$}-catenin, and {$\alpha$}N-catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin-2{$\alpha$} was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of nectin-2 did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin-2{$\alpha$} forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin-2{$\alpha$} spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.},

In the open field test of neophobia midazolam and physostigmine increased at a limited dose range, rat exploratory activity, after intracerebroventricular injection. Physostigmine produced in addition the hyperlocomotory effect. Following intraseptal injections, only physostigmine selectively prolonged the time spent by animals in the central sector of the open field. In the model of a conditioned fear, both midazolam and physostigmine inhibited rat freezing reaction to the aversively conditioned context after intracerebroventricular, but not after intraseptal, pretrial drug administration. The presented data support the notion about the selective anxiolytic-like effects of some AChE-Is. It appears, therefore, that the calming and sedative effects of AChE-Is observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease may be directly related to their anxiolytic action, independent of an improvement in cognitive functions, which in turn may decrease disorientation-induced distress and anxiety.},

To address this question, we genetically increased neuronal excitability of in vivo individual adult-born neurons in the mouse dentate gyrus via expression of a voltage-gated bacterial sodium channel. We observed that increasing the excitability of new neurons in an otherwise unperturbed circuit leads to changes in both their input and axonal synapses. Furthermore, the activity-dependent transcription factor Npas4 is necessary for the changes in the input synapses of these neurons, but it is not involved in changes to their axonal synapses. Our results reveal that an increase in cell-intrinsic activity during maturation is sufficient to alter the synaptic connectivity of a neuron with the hippocampal circuit and that Npas4 is required for activity-dependent changes in input synapses.},

Unbiased estimates of total neuron number within these regions were produced using a three-dimensional optical probe, the optical disector, in combination with a systematic random sampling scheme. Estimates of cell counts in immunostained tissue sections were conducted throughout the entire horizontal limb/nucleus basalis region. A significant 30\% decrease in both cholinergic and total neuron number was detected in the aged animals; GABAergic neuron number remained unchanged. Total neuron number was significantly correlated with the both cholinergic (r = 0.94) and glial cell number (r = 0.63), but not with GABAergic cell number. Based on neuron counts within an individual thick tissue section, the cholinergic neurons comprised only 11\textendash 15\% of all neurons in the nucleus basalis of young and aged animals. Cholinergic neuron loss accounted for only 20\% of the total age-related neuron loss within the horizontal limb/nucleus basalis in Fischer-344 male rats. These results indicate that age-related cholinergic neuron loss within the basal forebrain is reflected in reductions in total neuron number; however, GABAergic neurons, many of which project to the cortex, are unaffected by age. The magnitude of the age-related total neuron loss cannot be entirely accounted for by cholinergic cell loss. Therefore, an unidentified non-cholinergic, non-GABAergic component within the basal forebrain is also lost during aging and may contribute to the cognitive deficits previously ascribed to cholinergic dysfunction.},

Therefore, we investigated five computational electroencephalographic (EEG) measures as markers of ES. Methods: We measured 1) amplitude, 2) power spectra, 3) entropy, 4) long-range temporal correlations, via detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and 5) functional connectivity of EEG data from ES patients (n=40 patients) and healthy controls (n=20 subjects), with multiple blinded measurements during wakefulness and sleep for each patient. Results: In ES patients, EEG amplitude was significantly higher in all electrodes. Shannon and permutation entropy were lower in ES patients than control subjects, while DFA intercept values in ES patients were significantly higher than control subjects. DFA exponent values were not significantly different between the groups. EEG functional connectivity networks in ES patients were significantly stronger than controls. Using logistic regression, a multi-attribute classifier was derived that accurately distinguished cases from controls (area under curve of 0.96). Conclusions: Computational EEG features successfully distinguish ES patients from controls in a large, blinded study.

  abstract = {The long trains of theta field activity recorded from the hippocampal formation of urethane-anesthetized rats are thought to be primarily dependent on cholinergic afferents originating in the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/vDBB). Recent anatomical studies have revealed the existence of a septal GABA-ergic input to the hippocampal formation which synapses mainly on intrinsic GABA-ergic interneurons. The present work investigated the possibility that some form of interaction between cholinergic and GABA-ergic MS/vDBB inputs might be required for the generation of hippocampal theta field and cellular activities in urethane-anesthetized rats. Reversible inactivation of the MS/vDBB completely abolished theta field and theta-on cell activities, but ``released'' theta-off cells. The theta field and theta-on cell activities induced by direct intrahippocampal microinfusions of carbachol were also abolished by MS/vDBB inactivation. We speculated that septal suppression was producing two effects: 1) removing excitatory, cholinergic input; and 2) removing inhibitory control of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons, thereby increasing the overall level of hippocampal inhibition. Sequential administration of both carbachol and the GABA-A antagonist, bicuculline, resulted in theta-like oscillations similar to those seen in hippocampal slices bath perfused with carbachol alone. Thus, following MS/vDBB inactivation hippocampal GABA-ergic systems are overactive; this enhances intrinsic inhibition and blocks carbachol theta. By reducing the overall level of inhibition in the hippocampus with bicuculline, it is possible to reinstate its oscillatory properties. Conversely, increasing the level of inhibition in the hippocampus (with muscimol) results in the abolishment of theta field activity and the discharges of both theta-on and theta-off cells. Based on these findings we are proposing that cholinergic and GABA-ergic systems originating in the MS/vDBB act synergistically to modulate hippocampal theta. Cholinergic projections provide the afferent excitatory drive for hippocampal theta-on cells and septal GABA-ergic projections act to reduce the overall level of inhibition by inhibiting hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons (hippocampal theta-off cells). Both activities must be present for the generation of hippocampal theta field and cellular activities. The balance between the cholinergic and GABA-ergic systems may determine whether hippocampal synchrony (theta) or asynchrony (LIA) occurs.},

In this study, we attempted to examine how the inhibition of epilepsy-related cholinergic plasticity may be reflected in seizure susceptibility and/or in the development of chronic epilepsy and its neurological consequences. For this purpose, adult Wistar rats received intrahippocampal injections of low doses of 192-IgG-saporin (SAP) to produce a moderate, but significant loss of septohippocampal cholinergic cells and to suppress their plasticity. Then, animals were treated with kainic acid to induce status epilepticus, which leads to the development of chronic epilepsy later in life. It was found that SAP-pretreatment was associated with longer latency to the onset of status epilepticus and with reduced mortality rate, suggesting that increased activity of septal cholinergic cells may potentiate seizures. Interestingly, months later, a greater percentage of rats with intact septohippocampal cholinergic connections showed spontaneous seizures, when compared to SAP-pretreated rats. Treatment with kainic acid produced death of 40-50\% of hippocampal neurons and this effect was not ameliorated by prior cholinergic depletion. Moreover, the kainate induced cognitive deficits were detected in both SAP-pretreated and sham-pretreated groups. These data suggest that seizure-induced plasticity of cholinergic cells may indeed enhance seizure susceptibility and contribute to epileptogenic processes. They do not support the hypothesis that epilepsy-related hypertrophy of cholinergic neurons may potentiate hippocampal cell loss and respective behavioral impairments.},

We further examined the effects of epilepsy on the distribution pattern of cholinergic fiber varicosities in the parafascicular nucleus, one of the principal thalamic targets of PPN projections. The density of cholinergic varicosities, represented by two distinct populations, was increased in epileptic rats. These data provide the first morphological evidence for structural alterations in mesopontine cholinergic neurons in experimental epilepsy. They suggest dysfunctional cholinergic transmission in the brainstem-thalamic pathway, which may partly account for various epilepsy-related neurological disturbances.},

  abstract = {The septohippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission has long been implicated in seizures, but little is known about the structural features of this projection system in epileptic brain. We evaluated the effects of experimental epilepsy on the areal density of cholinergic terminals (fiber varicosities) in the dentate gyrus. For this purpose, we used two distinct post-status epilepticus rat models, in which epilepsy was induced with injections of either kainic acid or pilocarpine. To visualize the cholinergic fibers, we used brain sections immunostained for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter. It was found that the density of cholinergic fiber varicosities was higher in epileptic rats versus control rats in the inner and outer zones of the dentate molecular layer, but it was reduced in the dentate hilus. We further evaluated the effects of kainate treatment on the total number, density, and soma volume of septal cholinergic cells, which were visualized in brain sections stained for either vesicular acetylcholine transporter or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Both the number of septal cells with cholinergic phenotype and their density were increased in epileptic rats when compared to control rats. The septal cells stained for vesicular acetylcholine transporter, but not for ChAT, have enlarged perikarya in epileptic rats. These results revealed previously unknown details of structural reorganization of the septohippocampal cholinergic system in experimental epilepsy, involving fiber sprouting into the dentate molecular layer and a parallel fiber retraction from the dentate hilus. We hypothesize that epilepsy-related neuroplasticity of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons is capable of increasing neuronal excitability of the dentate gyrus.},

Among the potential methods, mechanical stimuli are the most promising vectors to convey information non-invasively into intact brain tissue. In this context, selective mechano-sensitization of neuronal circuits would pave the way to develop a new cell-type-specific stimulation approach. We report here, for the first time, the development and characterization of mechano-sensitized neuronal networks through the heterologous expression of an engineered bacterial large-conductance mechanosensitive ion channel (MscL). The neuronal functional expression of the MscL was validated through patch-clamp recordings upon application of calibrated suction pressures. Moreover, we verified the effective development of in-vitro neuronal networks expressing the engineered MscL in terms of cell survival, number of synaptic puncta and spontaneous network activity. The pure mechanosensitivity of the engineered MscL, with its wide genetic modification library, may represent a versatile tool to further develop a mechano-genetic approach.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},

This review will discuss the dopamine system and the circuits that regulate it, focusing on the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, thalamic nuclei, and medial septum, and the impact of stress.

Electrophysiologically, several classes of neurons have been described in the MSDB, but their chemical identity remains to be fully established. By combining electrophysiology with single-cell RT-PCR, we have identified four classes of neurons in the MSDB in vitro. The first class displayed slow-firing and little or no Ih, and expressed choline acetyl-transferase mRNA (ChAT). The second class was fast-firing, had a substantial Ih and expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 mRNA (GAD67), sometimes co-localized with ChAT mRNAs. A third class exhibited fast- and burst-firing, had an important Ih and expressed GAD67 mRNA also occasionally co-localized with ChAT mRNAs. The ionic mechanism underlying the bursts involved a low-threshold spike and a prominent Ih current, conductances often associated with pacemaker activity. Interestingly, we identified a fourth class that expressed transcripts solely for one or two of the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2), but not ChAT or GAD. Some putative glutamatergic neurons displayed electrophysiological properties similar to ChAT-positive slow-firing neurons such as the occurrence of a very small Ih, but nearly half of glutamatergic neurons exhibited cluster firing with intrinsically generated voltage-dependent subthreshold membrane oscillations. Neurons belonging to each of the four described classes were found among septohippocampal neurons by retrograde labelling. We provide results suggesting that slow-firing cholinergic, fast-firing and burst-firing GABAergic, and cluster-firing glutamatergic neurons, may each uniquely contribute to hippocampal rhythmicity in vivo.},

  abstract = {In classical fear conditioning, a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), which leads to a fear memory. If the CS is repeatedly presented without the US after fear conditioning, the formation of an extinction memory occurs, which inhibits fear memory expression. A previous study has demonstrated that selective cholinergic lesions in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal bands of Broca (MS/vDBB) prior to fear and extinction learning disrupt contextual fear memory discrimination and acquisition of extinction memory. MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons project to a number of substrates that are critical for fear and extinction memory. However, it is currently unknown which of these efferent projections are critical for contextual fear memory discrimination and extinction memory. To address this, we induced cholinergic lesions in efferent targets of MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons. These included the dorsal hippocampus (dHipp), ventral hippocampus (vHipp), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and in the mPFC and dHipp combined. None of these lesion groups exhibited deficits in contextual fear memory discrimination or extinction memory. However, vHipp cholinergic lesions disrupted auditory fear memory. Because MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons are the sole source of acetylcholine in the vHipp, these results suggest that MS/vDBB cholinergic input to the vHipp is critical for auditory fear memory. Taken together with previous findings, the results of this study suggest that MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons are critical for fear and extinction memory, though further research is needed to elucidate the role of MS/vDBB cholinergic neurons in these types of emotional memory.},

  abstract = {For over a century epileptic seizures have been known to cluster at specific times of the day. Recent studies have suggested that the circadian regulatory system may become permanently altered in epilepsy, but little is known about how this affects neural activity and the daily pattern of seizures. To investigate, we tracked long-term changes in the rate of spontaneous hippocampal EEG spikes (SPKs) in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In healthy animals, SPKs oscillated with near 24-h period; however, after injury by status epilepticus, a persistent phase shift of {$\sim$}12 h emerged in animals that later went on to develop chronic spontaneous seizures. Additional measurements showed that global 24-h rhythms, including core body temperature and theta state transitions, did not phase shift. Instead, we hypothesized that locally impaired circadian input to the hippocampus might be responsible for the SPK phase shift. This was investigated with a biophysical computer model in which we showed that subtle changes in the relative strengths of circadian input could produce a phase shift in hippocampal neural activity. MRI provided evidence that the medial septum, a putative circadian relay center for the hippocampus, exhibits signs of damage and therefore could contribute to local circadian impairment. Our results suggest that balanced circadian input is critical to maintaining natural circadian phase in the hippocampus and that damage to circadian relay centers, such as the medial septum, may disrupt this balance. We conclude by discussing how abnormal circadian regulation may contribute to the daily rhythms of epileptic seizures and related cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Recording many neurons for a long time The ultimate aim of chronic recordings is to sample from the same neuron over days and weeks. However, this goal has been difficult to achieve for large populations of neurons. Steinmetz et al. describe the development and testing of Neuropixels 2.0. This new electrophysiological recording tool is a miniaturized, high-density probe for both acute and long-term experiments combined with sophisticated software algorithms for fully automatic post hoc computational stabilization. The technique also provides a strategy for extending the number of recorded sites beyond the number of available recording channels. In freely moving animals, extremely large numbers of individual neurons could thus be followed and tracked with the same probe for weeks and occasionally months. Science, this issue p. eabf4588 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONElectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor silicon fabrication technology, such as Neuropixels probes, have enabled recordings of thousands of individual neurons in the living brain. These tools have led to discoveries about the brain-wide correlates of perception and action, primarily when used in acute, head-fixed recordings. To study the dynamics of neuronal processing across time scales, however, it is necessary to record from neurons over weeks and months, ideally during unrestrained behavior and in small animals, such as mice. RATIONALETo this end, we designed a miniaturized probe, called Neuropixels 2.0, with 5120 recording sites distributed over four shanks. The probe and headstage were miniaturized to about one-third of the original size (i.e., the size of the Neuropixels 1.0 probe), so that two probes and their single headstage weigh only \textasciitilde 1.1 g, without loss of channel count (384 channels per probe). Using two four-shank probes provides 10,240 recording sites in one implant. To achieve stable recordings despite brain movement, we optimized the recording site arrangement. The probe has a denser, linearized geometry that allows for post hoc computational motion correction using a newly designed algorithm. This algorithm, implemented in the Kilosort 2.5 software package, determines the motion over time from the spiking data and corrects it with spatial resampling, as in image registration. RESULTSTo validate these probes for long-term recordings, we implanted them chronically in 21 rats and mice in six laboratories. Twenty of these 21 implants succeeded and yielded neurons over weeks and months while retaining good signal quality. The probes were reliably recoverable using newly engineered implant fixture designs.To test the performance of the motion correction algorithm, we performed recordings with known imposed motion of the probe relative to the brain. The algorithm improved the yield of stable neurons and largely eliminated the impact of motion on the recording.A version of this algorithm allowed the recording of neurons stably across days. We assessed this by ``fingerprinting'' individual chronically recorded neurons in the primary visual cortex using their distinctive visual responses to a battery of images. Neuron tracking was {$>$}90\% successful for up to 2 weeks and {$>$}80\% successful for up to 2 months. CONCLUSIONThis work demonstrates a suite of electrophysiological tools comprising a miniaturized high-density probe, recoverable chronic implant fixtures, and algorithms for automatic post hoc motion correction. These tools enable an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of sites that can be recorded in small animals, such as mice, and the ability to record from them stably over long time scales. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/372/6539/eabf4588/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Neuropixels 2.0 probes allow unprecedented recordings.(A) Comparison of the Neuropixels 1.0 and 2.0 device designs.

Measuring the dynamics of neural processing across time scales requires following the spiking of thousands of individual neurons over milliseconds and months. To address this need, we introduce the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with newly designed analysis algorithms. The probe has more than 5000 sites and is miniaturized to facilitate chronic implants in small mammals and recording during unrestrained behavior. High-quality recordings over long time scales were reliably obtained in mice and rats in six laboratories. Improved site density and arrangement combined with newly created data processing methods enable automatic post hoc correction for brain movements, allowing recording from the same neurons for more than 2 months. These probes and algorithms enable stable recordings from thousands of sites during free behavior, even in small animals such as mice. An approach has been developed that allows recording from the same neurons in a freely behaving animal for weeks and months.

We have examined the effects of OBX on behavior and the parameters of the cholinergic system in female rats and mice. In rats, OBX resulted in the appearance of some depressive-like behavioral marks, such as the decreased sucrose consumption, hyperactivity, impaired short-term memory and anxiety-like behavioral features, such as shortened presence in the center of the open field arena or open arms of the elevated plus-maze and an enhancement of avoidance behavior. These behavioral abnormalities could be associated with disturbances in hippocampal function, this suggestion being supported by the presence of cellular changes in this brain structure. No effect of OBX on the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band as well as on the acetylcholine content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the septum, hippocampus, and neocortex could be detected. In contrast, in mice, OBX impaired spontaneous alternation behavior and decreased the number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band. These data demonstrate that rats and mice differently respond to OBX, in particular, OBX does not significantly affect the cholinergic system in rats.},

We recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination thresholds of 0.35\textdegree{} and 0.37\textdegree, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory brain areas.

  abstract = {Cholinergic inputs from the medial septum are projected to pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and release acetylcholine (ACh) from their terminals. The cholinergic inputs are considered to be integrated with sensory inputs and to play a crucial role in learning and memory. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the relative timing between pre- and post-synaptic spiking determines the direction and extent of synaptic changes in a critical temporal window, a process known as spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Positive timing where excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) precedes the postsynaptic action potential induces long-term potentiation (LTP) while negative timing where EPSP follows the action potential induces long-term depression (LTD). To investigate the influence of muscarinic activation by cholinergic inputs on synaptic plasticity, STDP-inducing stimuli were applied during the muscarinic induction of a slow EPSP followed by repetitive stimulation in the stratum oriens. As a result, LTP was facilitated and LTD was abolished by the muscarinic activation. Furthermore, interestingly, LTP was also facilitated and LTD was switched to LTP with an increase in ACh concentration following application of the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. These results indicate that the orientation of plasticity was shifted for potentiation by muscarinic activation. On the other hand, the application of excess ACh concentration completely suppressed STDP, LTP and LTD. In addition, STDP was suppressed in the presence of atropine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist. Taken together, the findings suggest that synaptic plasticity modulation depends on the amount of cholinergic inputs. The modulation of synaptic plasticity by muscarinic activation might be an important stage in the integration of top-down and bottom-up information in hippocampal CA1 neurons.},

  abstract = {We developed and applied a Cre-dependent, genetically modified rabies-based tracing system to map direct synaptic connections to specific CA1 neuron types in the mouse hippocampus. We found common inputs to excitatory and inhibitory CA1 neurons from CA3, CA2, the entorhinal cortex (EC), the medial septum (MS), and, unexpectedly, the subiculum. Excitatory CA1 neurons receive inputs from both cholinergic and GABAergic MS neurons, whereas inhibitory neurons receive a great majority of inputs from GABAergic MS neurons. Both cell types also receive weaker input from glutamatergic MS neurons. Comparisons of inputs to CA1 PV+ interneurons versus SOM+ interneurons showed similar strengths of input from the subiculum, but PV+ interneurons received much stronger input than SOM+ neurons from CA3, the EC, and the MS. Thus, rabies tracing identifies hippocampal circuit connections and maps how the different input sources to CA1 are distributed with different strengths on each of its constituent cell types.},

  abstract = {Cavitation-facilitated microbubble-mediated focused ultrasound therapy is a promising method of drug delivery across the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB) for treating many neurological disorders. Unlike ultrasound thermal therapies, during which magnetic resonance thermometry can serve as a reliable treatment control modality, real-time control of modulated BBB disruption with undetectable vascular damage remains a challenge. Here a closed-loop cavitation controlling paradigm that sustains stable cavitation while suppressing inertial cavitation behavior was designed and validated using a dual-transducer system operating at the clinically relevant ultrasound frequency of 274.3 kHz. Tests in the normal brain and in the F98 glioma model in vivo demonstrated that this controller enables reliable and damage-free delivery of a predetermined amount of the chemotherapeutic drug (liposomal doxorubicin) into the brain. The maximum concentration level of delivered doxorubicin exceeded levels previously shown (using uncontrolled sonication) to induce tumor regression and improve survival in rat glioma. These results confirmed the ability of the controller to modulate the drug delivery dosage within a therapeutically effective range, while improving safety control. It can be readily implemented clinically and potentially applied to other cavitation-enhanced ultrasound therapies.},

Injections in the anteroventral part of the lateral preoptic area labeled fibers projecting through, and perhaps to, the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas and ending in the supramammillary region and ventral fiber lamina of the mammillary complex; other labeled fibers ended in the periventricular hypothalamic gray and the internal lamina of the median eminence. The posteromedial lateral preoptic area projects to the same regions, as well as to the medial septal-diagonal band complex, and to the lateral habenula through the stria medullaris. Injections of the posterolateral lateral preoptic area labeled each of the above fiber systems as well as fibers to the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus and taenia tecta. Other fibers coursed over the genu of the corpus callosum, through the stria terminalis and ansa peduncularis to the medial, cortical and basal amygdaloid nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area, and through the medial forebrain bundle to the substantia nigra. The transition region between the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas at the level of the supraoptic nucleus has widespread connections as a whole (a) with the medial septal-diagonal band complex, lateral septum and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, (b) through or to most of the hypothalamus, the substantia nigra, central tegmental field, central gray, superior central nucleus, and the locus coeruleus, (c) through the stria medullaris to the lateral habenula (bilaterally), parataenial, paraventricular, and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, (d) through the stria terminalis and ansa peduncularis to the central, medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, and (e) to the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, cingulate bundle, olfactory tubercle, medial septaldiagonal band complex and the lateral septum. Injections of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus label fibers (a) anteriorly to the main olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle, and to the medial septal-diagonal band complex, (b) posteriorly through the medial forebrain bundle to the lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas, internal lamina of the median eminence, supramammillary region, ventral fiber lamina of the mammillary complex, posterior hypothalamic area, central gray, locus coeruleus, and ventral tegmental area, (c) to the medial, cortical and basal amygdaloid nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area, and (d) through the stria medullaris to the mediodorsal nucleus, lateral habenula, and contralateral magnocellular preoptic nucleus. The preoptic continuation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis projects to the medial, central, and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei, to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and lateral habenular nucleus: through the stria medullaris, and to the substantia innominata, anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, hypothalamic periventricular gray, fiber capsule of the ventromedial nucleus, internal lamina of the median eminence, supramammillary region, ventral fiber lamina of the mammillary complex, posterior hypothalamic area, central gray, locus coeruleus and ventral tegmental area. The medial preoptic area appears to project to the hypophysiotrophic zone of the hypothalamus including the periventricular gray, internal lamina of the median eminence, lateral hypothalamic area, ventromedial nucleus, and ventral fiber lamina of the mammillary complex. Neurons in the dorsal part of the periventricular preoptic nucleus project to the laterally adjacent lateral preoptic and lateral hypothalamic areas while those in an intermediate location send additional fibers to the supraoptic nucleus. The ventralmost cells in the preoptic periventricular nucleus project to the hypophysiotrophic zone of the hypothalamus in much the same way as the anteriorly adjacent suprachiasmatic nucleus (Swanson and Cowan, '75c).},

The lateral septal nucleus, which can be divided into dorsal, intermediate and ventral parts, receives its major input from the hippocampal formation and projects to the medial septal-diagonal band complex. The ventral part of the nucleus also sends fibers through the medial forebrain bundle to the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas, to the lateral hypothalamic area and the dorsomedial nucleus, to the mammillary body (including the supramammillary region), and to the ventral tegmental area. The medial septal nucleus/diagonal band complex projects back to the hippocampal formation by way of the dorsal fornix, fimbria, and possibly the cingulum. Both nuclei also project through the medial forebrain bundle to the medial and lateral preoptic areas, to the lateral hypothalamic area, and to the mammillary complex. The medial septal nucleus also sends fibers to the midbrain (the ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei) and to the parataenial nucleus of the thalamus, while the nucleus of the diagonal band has an additional projection to the anterior limbic area. Ascending inputs to the medial septal nucleus/diagonal band complex arise in several hypothalamic nuclei and in the brainstem aminergic cell groups. The posterior septal nuclei (the septofimbrail and triangular nuclei) receive their major input from the hippocampal formation, and project in a topographically ordered manner upon the habenular nuclei and the interpeduncular nuclear complex. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis receives its major input from the amygdala (Krettek and Price, '78); but other afferents arise from the ventral subiculum, the ventromedial nucleus, and the brainstem aminergic cell groups. The principal output of the bed nucleus is through the medial forebrain bundle to the substantia innominata, the nucleus accumbens, most parts of the hypothalamus and the preoptic area, the central tegmental fields of the midbrain, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal and median nuclei of the raphe, and the locus coeruleus.

First, the distribution, within the VTA and adjacent regions, of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells that project to terminal fields in the telencephalon (nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, pre- and supragenual fields of the anterior limbic cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal area), in the diencephalon (lateral habenula), and in the brainstem (locus coeruleus, and parabrachial nucleus) was determined. Then, 15 different combinations of injections of the tracers bisbenzimide and true blue into different terminal fields were made to determine whether individual cells in the region of the VTA send collaterals to more than one site. Taken together, the results indicate that essentially separate groups of cells in the VTA and adjacent regions of the raphe project to each terminal field. In addition, each group can be further divided into dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic components, although the proportion of dopaminergic cells in each group can vary from over 80\% (e.g., to the nucleus accumbens) to less than 1\% (to the lateral habenula and to the locus coeruleus). In addition, it was found that the supramammillary region, which contains a dense extension of the A10 cell group in its medial part, and the tuberomammillary nucleus, project to, or through, most of the regions injected with retrograde tracers. Virtually all of the projections from the VTA and adjacent regions are partially crossed, the percentage of cells on the uninjected side ranging from over 40\% (e.g., for locus coeruleus injections) to only about 2\% (e.g., for amygdalar injections). Most of the groups of projection neurons in the region of the VTA are considerably intermixed with the exception of those that project to the lateral septum, to the lateral habenula, and to the hippocampal formation, which are concentrated in ventral and medial parts of the VTA, and in the raphe nuclei medial to the VTA. It was concluded that in the ventral part of the midbrain, essentially separate groups of aminergic and non-aminergic neurons in both the reticular formation (VTA) and in the adjacent nuclei of the raphe project bilaterally to a variety of similar terminal fields in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and brainstem. Further work at the single cell level is needed to determine whether these cell groups are differentially innervated by known inputs to the VTA and adjacent regions, most of which appear to descend through the medial forebrain bundle from sites in the limbic system and hypothalamus.},

In this study, by using chemo/optogenetic techniques along with feeding assays, we investigate how neurons within the medial septal complex (MSc), a brain area implicated in emotion and cognition, contribute to food intake. We find that chemo/optogenetic activation of MSc glutamatergic neurons profoundly reduces food intake during both light and dark periods of the rodent light cycle. Furthermore, we find that selective activation of MSc glutamatergic projections in paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) reduces food intake, suggesting that MSc glutamatergic neurons suppress feeding by activating downstream neurons in the PVH. Open-field behavioral assays reveal that these neurons do not overtly affect anxiety levels and locomotion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that septal glutamatergic neurons exert anorexigenic effects by projecting to the PVH without affecting anxiety and physical activities.},

  abstract = {Feeding behavior is orchestrated by neural circuits primarily residing in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. However, the relative influence of cognitive and emotional brain circuits to the feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus and hindbrain remains unclear. Here, using the cell-type selectivity of genetic methods, circuit mapping, and behavior assays, we sought to decipher neural circuits emanating from the septal nucleus to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that contribute to neural regulation of food intake in mice. We found that chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of septal vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT)-containing neurons or their projections in the LH reduced food intake in mice. Consistently, chemogenetic inhibition of septal vGAT neurons increased food intake. Furthermore, we investigated a previously unknown neural circuit originating from septal vGAT neurons to a subset of vGAT neurons in the LH, an area involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of energy states. Collectively, our data reveal an inhibitory septohypothalamic feeding circuit that might serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our results demonstrate that top-down projections from the septum to the hypothalamus control food intake negatively. Given the known role for both of these brain regions in the control of feeding and emotion-related behaviors, these findings reveal previously unknown neural circuitry that is likely implicated in emotional aspects of food intake and provide new insights into the development of therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders.},

  abstract = {The impact of time wasted The amount of time already spent on a task influences human choice about whether to continue. This dedicated time, known as the ``sunk cost,'' reduces the likelihood of giving up the pursuit of a reward, even when there is no indication of likely success. Sweis et al. show that this sensitivity to time invested occurs similarly in mice, rats, and humans (see the Perspective by Brosnan). All three display a resistance to giving up their pursuit of a reward in a foraging context, but only after they have made the decision to pursue the reward. Science, this issue p. 178; see also p. 124 Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species. Mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivity to time invested when making foraging decisions. Mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivity to time invested when making foraging decisions.},

  abstract = {The basal forebrain cholinergic system is widely assumed to control cortical functions via non-synaptic transmission of a single neurotransmitter. Yet, we find that mouse hippocampal cholinergic terminals invariably establish GABAergic synapses, and their cholinergic vesicles dock at those synapses only. We demonstrate that these synapses do not co-release but co-transmit GABA and acetylcholine via different vesicles, whose release is triggered by distinct calcium channels. This co-transmission evokes composite postsynaptic potentials, which are mutually cross-regulated by presynaptic autoreceptors. Although postsynaptic cholinergic receptor distribution cannot be investigated, their response latencies suggest a focal, intra- and/or peri-synaptic localisation, while GABAA receptors are detected intra-synaptically. The GABAergic component alone effectively suppresses hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and epileptiform activity. Therefore, the differentially regulated GABAergic and cholinergic co-transmission suggests a hitherto unrecognised level of control over cortical states. This novel model of hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission may lead to alternative pharmacotherapies after cholinergic deinnervation seen in neurodegenerative disorders.},

Early termination through spatially extensive hippocampal intervention is not feasible directly, because of the large size and irregular shape of the hippocampus. In contrast, the medial septum is a promising target to govern hippocampal oscillations through its divergent connections to both hippocampi. Combining this `proxy intervention' concept and precisely timed stimulation, we report here that closed-loop medial septum electrical stimulation can quickly terminate intrahippocampal seizures and suppress secondary generalization in a rat kindling model. Precise stimulus timing governed by internal seizure rhythms was essential. Cell type-specific stimulation revealed that the precisely timed activation of medial septum GABAergic neurons underlaid the effects. Our concept of time-targeted proxy stimulation for intervening pathological oscillations can be extrapolated to other neurological and psychiatric disorders, and has potential for clinical translation.},

  abstract = {The medial septum (MS), as part of the basal forebrain, supports many physiological functions, from sensorimotor integration to cognition. With often reciprocal connections with a broad set of peers at all major divisions of the brain, the MS orchestrates oscillatory neuronal activities throughout the brain. These oscillations are critical in generating sensory and emotional salience, locomotion, maintaining mood, supporting innate anxiety, and governing learning and memory. Accumulating evidence points out that the physiological oscillations under septal influence are frequently disrupted or altered in pathological conditions. Therefore, the MS may be a potential target for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders with abnormal oscillations (oscillopathies) to restore healthy patterns or erase undesired ones. Recent studies have revealed that the patterned stimulation of the MS alleviates symptoms of epilepsy. We discuss here that stimulus timing is a critical determinant of treatment efficacy on multiple time scales. On-demand stimulation may dramatically reduce side effects by not interfering with normal physiological functions. A precise pattern-matched stimulation through adaptive timing governed by the ongoing oscillations is essential to effectively terminate pathological oscillations. The time-targeted strategy for the MS stimulation may provide an effective way of treating multiple disorders including Alzheimer\&rsquo;s disease, anxiety/fear, schizophrenia, and depression, as well as pain.},

However, there is currently no documentation on technical aspects of CMAP recordings via reconstructed or regenerated facial nerves. We have studied new techniques of plastic surgery and nerve regeneration using a rat facial nerve defect model for years, standardizing an evaluation pipeline using CMAP recordings. Here we describe our CMAP recording procedure in detail as a package including surgical preparation, data acquisition, analysis and troubleshooting. Each resource is available in public repositories and is maintained as a version control system. In addition, we demonstrate that our analytical pipeline can not only be applied to rats, but also mice. Finally, we show that CMAP recordings can be practically combined with other behavioral and anatomical examinations. For example, retrograde motor neuron labeling provides anatomical evidence for physical routes between the facial motor nucleus and its periphery through reconstructed or regenerated facial nerves, in addition to electrophysiological evidence by CMAP recordings from the same animal. \textbullet Standardized surgical, recording and analytical procedures for the functional evaluation of reconstructed or regenerated facial nerves of rats, extended to mice.\textbullet The functional evaluation can be combined with anatomical evaluations.\textbullet The methods described here are maintained in public repositories as version control systems.},

Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction.

Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.},

Although it was reported to be dominantly expressed in the brain, its detailed distribution and function in the central nervous system are still obscure. In the present study we demonstrated that in the rat relaxin 3 was mainly expressed in neurons of the nucleus incertus (NI) of the median dorsal tegmental pons. Other relaxin 3-expressing neurons were scattered in the pontine raphe nucleus, the periaqueductal gray and dorsal area to the substantia nigra in the midbrain reticular formation. Relaxin 3-immunoreactive fibers projected particularly densely in the septum, hippocampus, lateral hypothalamus and intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus. Ultrastructural examination revealed that relaxin 3 was localized in the dense-cored vesicles in the perikarya and was also observed in the synaptic terminals of axons. As almost all relaxin 3-containing neurons express corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor in the NI, we examined the response of relaxin 3 neurons to intracerebroventricular administration of CRF; 65\% of relaxin 3 neurons expressed c-Fos 2 h after intracerebroventricular administration of 1 \textmu g CRF. We then confirmed that c-Fos was induced in 60\% of relaxin 3 neurons in the NI and the expression of relaxin 3 mRNA increased significantly in the NI after water-restraint stress. Collectively, these results suggest that relaxin 3 produced in the NI is released from nerve endings and is involved in the regulation of the stress response.},

  abstract = {Much can be learned about the brain's function in pain processing through electrical stimulation. The spinothalamic tract which is conceived to be the chief pathway for nociceptive pain and whose interruption induces dissociated sensory loss can be recognized from the anterolateral columns of the spinal cord to the posterior thalamus by the induction of feelings of chiefly contralateral, somatotopographically organized, warm, cool, or cold sensations, less often burning and rarely pain. The spinoreticulothalamic tract, whose function in normal pain processing is controversial and whose interruption produces no clinically detectable sensory loss, is normally silent to stimulation. However, in patients with deafferentation pain, it appears to become sensitive to electrical stimulation, both in the anterolateral columns and in midbrain and medial thalamus, giving rise to chiefly contralateral, non-somatotopographically organized, burning or painful sensations which often reproduce fairly accurately the patient's pain. This phenomenon, which does not appear to occur in patients with nociceptive pain, may reflect denervation neuronal hypersensitivity which is a possible pathophysiological mechanism explaining deafferentation pain. The dorsal column/lemniscal system can be recognized by electrical stimulation from the spinal cord to the somatosensory cortex by the induction of paraesthesiae. Its chronic stimulation at the level of the dorsal column, the ventrocaudal nucleus or the internal capsule appears capable of suppressing deafferentation pain. The arc of neuronal tissue extending from the septal area through hypothalamus and periventricular grey to the periaqueductal grey, which acts as a receptor area for opiates and endorphins, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on access to the spinothalamic tract, can also be exploited through chronic stimulation for the control of pain. Stimulation of the periventricular area gives rise to feelings of warmth, comfort and relaxation, of the hypothalamus, horror and autonomic effects while that of the periaqueductal grey induces discomfort, distress, anxiety and weeping, and of the septal area flushing, paraesthesiae, nausea, nystagmus and a feeling of warmth. Thus four brain systems involved in pain signalling can be recognized by electrical stimulation, one which conveys nociceptive pain to consciousness, another that suppresses it, one that may undergo denervation neuronal hypersensitivity and bring deafferentation pain into consciousness, possibly by establishing novel connectivity and one that is presumably capable of suppressing that hyperactivity.},

This is partly due to a lack of tools enabling specific intervention in, and recording of, cholinergic transmission.

A point mutation (R100W) in the NGFB gene was found in patients with Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V), which leads to pain insensitivity. In a previous work it has been shown that the mutation provokes a reduced secretion of mature NGF. In this study we generated and analyzed homozygous NGFR100W/R100W mice to understand whether the reduced NGF bioavailability can contribute to the clinical phenotype of the homozygous condition. We found that the majority of NGFR100W/R100W mice were born normal but failed to reach the first month of age. This early lethality was rescued by daily treatment with wild type NGF. In addition, we found that the density of cholinergic neurons of homozygous mice was unaffected in the medial septum and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, whereas, suprisingly, it was increased specifically in the striatum. Due to the known action of the striatal cholinergic tone in modulating pain, our findings support the hypothesis that a central mechanism, linked to the NGFR100W-dependent increase of the striatal cholinergic tone, can contribute to the pain insensitivity observed in HSAN V patients.},

The phototransduction pathway in the retina starts from the first-order neurons, the photoreceptor cells, and transmits the signals to second-order neurons. Finally, the output signal from third-order neurons, the ganglion cells, is carried to the brain. The photoreceptor cells are the only neurons in the retina that can respond to a light signal; they are hyperpolarised when they receive light, and the ganglion cells carry the signals to the brain following the depolarization. Recently, various types of channelrhodopsins have been found and developed. It is expected that the gene therapies using the cation channel as well as anion channelrhodopsin genes would be effective against diseases that cause severe destruction of visual function, such as the retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. In this review, we mainly describe mVChR1-mediated gene therapy for retinitis pigmentosa and the future application of optogenetic genes in retinal diseases.},

Electron microscopic analysis showed that the majority of the anterogradely labeled boutons formed symmetric synapses with dendrites and occasionally with cell bodies located in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. We have demonstrated with postembedding GABA immunocytochemistry that the majority of PHAL-labeled axon terminals were GABAergic. The neurochemical character of the postsynaptic target cells was also investigated using immunocytochemical double staining. Our data showed that the majority of the labeled hippocamposeptal axons innervated parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells representing GABAergic projection neurons, and a smaller number of contacts were found on ChAT-positive neurons. Septohippocampal neurons identified by retrograde HRP transport were also shown to reactive direct hippocamposeptal input. According to recent results, the lateral septum is unlikely to relay the hippocampal feedback to the medial septum; therefore, the direct hippocampal projection to the medial septum, arising from GABAergic nonpyramidal cells, seems to be the only feedback pathway to the area containing septohippocampal neurons. A novel circuit diagram, based on our recent morphological-immunocytochemical findings, is shown for the synaptic organization of the septo-hippocampo-septal loop. We suggest that the GABAergic hippocamposeptal feedback controls the activity of septal (mostly GABAergic) projection neurons as a function of hippocampal synchrony. The newly discovered reciprocal interactions may give a better insight into septohippocampal physiology.},

We propose that we need a new approach, an Open Science Platform, that takes the benefits of preprints but adds formal, invited, and transparent post-publication peer review. This bypasses the problems of the current journal system and, in doing so, moves the evaluation of research and researchers away from the journal-based Impact Factor and towards a fairer system of article-based qualitative and quantitative indicators.

The outcome largely depends on etiology, but prompt and appropriate pharmacological therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality.

Immediate concerns include supporting respiration, maintaining blood pressure, gaining intravenous access, and identifying and treating the underlying cause. Initial therapeutic and diagnostic measures are conducted simultaneously. The goal of therapy is rapid termination of clinical and electrical seizure activity; the longer a seizure continues, the greater the likelihood of an adverse outcome. Several drug protocols now in use will terminate status epilepticus.

However, it remains unclear how these DNA variants affect neurexin functions and thereby predispose to these neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding both the wild-type and pathologic roles of these genes in the brain could help unveil biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders. In this regard, numerous studies have focused on generating relevant loss-of-function (LOF) mammalian models. Although this has increased our knowledge about their normal functions, the potential pathologic role(s) of these human variants remains elusive. Indeed, after reviewing the literature, it seems apparent that a traditional LOF-genetic approach based on complete LOF might not be sufficient to unveil the role of these human mutations. First, these genes present a very complex transcriptome and total-LOF of all isoforms may not be the cause of toxicity in patients, particularly given evidence that causative variants act through haploinsufficiency. Moreover, human DNA variants may not all lead to LOF but potentially to intricate transcriptome changes that could also include the generation of aberrant isoforms acting as a gain-of-function (GOF). Furthermore, their transcriptomic complexity most likely renders them prone to genetic compensation when one tries to manipulate them using traditional site-directed mutagenesis approaches, and this could act differently from model to model leading to heterogeneous and conflicting phenotypes. This review compiles the relevant literature on variants identified in human studies and on the mouse models currently deployed, and offers suggestions for future research.},

While the medial septum has been implicated, predominantly, in theta rhythm generation along the septo-hippocampal axis, the lateral septum has mainly been investigated in the context of septo-hypothalamic dialogue. Recent advances suggest that medial and lateral septum are more closely functionally related than previously appreciated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the medial septum mediates ascending septo-hippocampal theta propagation, while the lateral septum processes a descending hippocampo-septal and septo-hypothalamic reinforcement signal that mediates navigation during motivated behaviour. The generation and propagation of theta rhythm are critical for the initiation of exploratory behaviour. Indeed, theta signal processing of medial and lateral septum nuclei may well be involved in the integration of spatial, rewarding and locomotor signals across different brain networks. We review here the structural features, anatomical connectivity and functional properties of the medial and lateral septum. We discuss the heterogeneous anatomy of the lateral septum, which is composed of diverse subregions with distinct ascending and descending projections, and we relate the physiological characteristics of septal nuclei to their functional relationships with the hippocampal formation, the hypothalamus and the brainstem reticular formation during motivated spatial navigation.},

Besides the field mapping and head-directional information, the linear velocity is among the major signals that guide animal's spatial navigation. Large neuronal populations in the same limbic regions oscillate with theta rhythm during spatial navigation or attention episodes; and the frequency of theta also correlates with linear velocity. A functional similarity between these brain areas is that their inactivation impairs the ability to form new spatial memories; whereas an anatomical similarity is that they all receive projections from medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. We review recent findings supporting the model that septal theta rhythm integrates different sensorimotor signals necessary for spatial navigation. The medial septal is described here as a circuitry that mediates experience-dependent balance of sustained attention and path integration during navigation. We discuss the hypothesis that theta rhythm serves as a key mechanism for the aligning of intrinsic spatial representation to 1) rapid change of position in the spatial environment 2) continuous alteration of sensory signals throughout navigation and 3) adapting levels of attentional behaviour. The synchronization of these spatial, somatosensory and neuromodulatory signals is proposed here to be anatomically and physiologically mediated by the medial septum.},

  abstract = {The goal of this review is an overview of the structural elements of the entorhinal\textendash hippocampal connection. The development of the dendrites of hippocampal neurons will be outlined in relation to afferent pathway specificity and the mature dendritic structure compared. Interneurons will be contrasted to pyramidal cells in terms of processing of physiological signals and convergence and divergence in control of hippocampal circuits. Mechanisms of axonal guidance and target recognition, target structures, the involvement of receptor distribution on hippocampal dendrites and the involvement of non-neuronal cellular elements in the establishment of specific connections will be presented. Mechanisms relevant for the maintenance of shape and morphological specializations of hippocampal dendrites will be reviewed. One of the significant contexts in which to view these structural elements is the degree of plasticity in which they participate, during development and origination of dendrites, mature synaptic plasticity and after lesions, when the cells must continue to maintain and reconstitute function, to remain part of the circuitry in the hippocampus. This review will be presented in four main sections: (1) interneurons\textemdash development, role in synchronizing influence and hippocampal network functioning; (2) principal cells in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus regions\textemdash their development, function in terms of synaptic integration, differentiating structure and alterations with lesions; (3) glia and glia/neuronal interactions\textemdash response to lesions and developmental guidance mechanisms; and (4) network and circuit aspects of hippocampal morphology and functioning. Finally, the interwoven role of these various elements participating in hippocampal network function will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation are therapeutically effective in treating some neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Optogenetic-based neurostimulation approaches are capable of activating individual synapses and yield the highest spatial control over brain circuit activity. Both electrical and light-based neurostimulation methods require intrusive procedures such as surgical implantation of electrodes or photon-emitting devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has also shown therapeutic effectiveness and represents a recent paradigm shift towards implementing less invasive brain stimulation methods. Magnetic-based stimulation, however, has a limited focusing capacity and lacks brain penetration power. Because ultrasound can be noninvasively transmitted through the skull to targeted deep brain circuits, it may offer alternative approaches to currently employed neuromodulation techniques. Encouraging this idea, literature spanning more than half a century indicates that ultrasound can modulate neuronal activity. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms underlying the actions of ultrasound on neuronal excitability, here, I propose the continuum mechanics hypothesis of ultrasonic neuromodulation in which ultrasound produces effects on viscoelastic neurons and their surrounding fluid environments to alter membrane conductance. While further studies are required to test this hypothesis, experimental data indicate ultrasound represents a promising platform for developing future therapeutic neuromodulation approaches.},

The pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to the signs and symptoms of the disorder are still unclear, however.Neural oscillations and their synchronization may be core pathophysiological mechanisms in schizophrenia, as neural oscillations are fundamental for coordinated neural activity during normal brain functioning.Recent evidence shows that schizophrenia is associated with deficits in neural oscillations, especially in the beta- and gamma-band frequencies. These impairments closely correlate with cognitive dysfunctions and the core symptoms of the disorder.Dysfunctions in neural synchrony could result from deficits in GABA ({$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid)-ergic neurotransmission and the reduced integrity of cortico-cortical connections, which are crucially involved in the generation of synchronized, oscillatory activity.Developmentally, neural oscillations are involved in the maturation of cortical networks during early and late critical periods that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Temporal coordination of neuronal assemblies among cortical areas is essential for behavioral performance. GABAergic projections from the medial septum and diagonal band complex exclusively innervate GABAergic interneurons in the rat hippocampus, contributing to the coordination of neuronal activity, including the generation of theta oscillations. Much less is known about the synaptic target neurons outside the hippocampus. To reveal the contribution of synaptic circuits involving the medial septum of mice, we have identified postsynaptic cortical neurons in wild-type and parvalbumin-Cre knock-in mice. Anterograde axonal tracing from the septum revealed extensive innervation of the hippocampus as well as the subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, and the retrosplenial cortex. In all examined cortical regions, many septal GABAergic boutons were in close apposition to somata or dendrites immunopositive for interneuron cell-type molecular markers, such as parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 1, cholecystokinin, reelin, or a combination of these molecules. Electron microscopic observations revealed septal boutons forming axosomatic or axodendritic type II synapses. In the CA1 region of hippocampus, septal GABAergic projections exclusively targeted interneurons. In the retrosplenial cortex, 93\% of identified postsynaptic targets belonged to interneurons and the rest to pyramidal cells. These results suggest that the GABAergic innervation from the medial septum and diagonal band complex contributes to temporal coordination of neuronal activity via several types of cortical GABAergic interneurons in both hippocampal and extrahippocampal cortices. Oscillatory septal neuronal firing at delta, theta, and gamma frequencies may phase interneuron activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Diverse types of GABAergic interneurons coordinate the firing of cortical principal cells required for memory processes. During wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep, the rhythmic firing of cortical GABAergic neurons plays a key role in governing network activity. We investigated subcortical GABAergic projections in the mouse that extend from the medial septum/diagonal band nuclei to GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus and related extrahippocampal cortical areas, including the medial entorhinal cortex. These areas contribute to navigation and show theta rhythmic activity. We found selective GABAergic targeting of different groups of cortical GABAergic neurons, immunoreactive for combinations of cell-type markers. As septal GABAergic neurons also fire rhythmically, their selective innervation of cortical GABAergic neurons suggests an oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity across functionally related areas.},

However, this prediction neglects the effects of correlations on information readout. We studied how correlations affect both encoding and readout of sensory information. We analyzed calcium imaging data from mouse posterior parietal cortex during two perceptual discrimination tasks. Correlations reduced the encoded stimulus information, but, seemingly paradoxically, were higher when mice made correct rather than incorrect choices. Single-trial behavioral choices depended not only on the stimulus information encoded by the whole population, but unexpectedly also on the consistency of information across neurons and time. Because correlations increased information consistency, they enhanced the conversion of sensory information into behavioral choices, overcoming their detrimental information-limiting effects. Thus, correlations in association cortex can benefit task performance even if they decrease sensory information.},

In contrast to this general rule, we describe a distinct neuron type in mice and rats whose spiking activity is anti-correlated with all principal cells and interneurons in all brain states but, most prevalently, during the down state of non-REM (NREM) sleep. We identify these down state-active (DSA) neurons as deep-layer neocortical neurogliaform cells that express ID2 and Nkx2.1 and are weakly immunoreactive to neuronal nitric oxide synthase. DSA neurons are weakly excited by deep-layer pyramidal cells and strongly inhibited by several other GABAergic cell types. Spiking of DSA neurons modified the sequential firing order of other neurons at down\textendash up transitions. Optogenetic activation of ID2+Nkx2.1+ interneurons in the posterior parietal cortex during NREM sleep, but not during waking, interfered with consolidation of cue discrimination memory. Despite their sparsity, DSA neurons perform critical physiological functions.},

The different populations of medial septal neurons (cholinergic and GABAergic) are assumed to affect different aspects of theta oscillations. Using optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons in ChAT-Cre mice, we investigated their effects on hippocampal local field potentials in both anesthetized and behaving mice. Cholinergic stimulation completely blocked sharp wave ripples and strongly suppressed the power of both slow oscillations (0.5\textendash 2 Hz in anesthetized, 0.5\textendash 4 Hz in behaving animals) and supratheta (6\textendash 10 Hz in anesthetized, 10\textendash 25 Hz in behaving animals) bands. The same stimulation robustly increased both the power and coherence of theta oscillations (2\textendash 6 Hz) in urethane-anesthetized mice. In behaving mice, cholinergic stimulation was less effective in the theta (4\textendash 10 Hz) band yet it also increased the ratio of theta/slow oscillation and theta coherence. The effects on gamma oscillations largely mirrored those of theta. These findings show that medial septal cholinergic activation can both enhance theta rhythm and suppress peri-theta frequency bands, allowing theta oscillations to dominate.},

  abstract = {Stainless steel macro-electrodes were chronically implanted in 24 adult male hooded rats. EEG recordings were taken from the hippocampal formation, diencephalon and neocortex and were correlated with observations of spontaneous or conditioned behavior. Trains of rhythmical 6\textendash 12 c/sec waves in the hippocampus and medial thalamus precede and accompany gross voluntary types of movement such as walking, rearing, jumping, etc. Behavioral immobility (in the alert state) and automatic movement patterns such as blinking, scratching, washing the face, licking or biting the fur, chewing food or lapping water are associated with irregular hippocampal activity. Small movements, such as shifts of posture or isolated movements of the head or limbs occurring during immobility, or during grooming or feeding behavior, are associated with rhythmical activity of reduced amplitude and lowered mean frequency. A shock avoidance response is preceded by an increase in wave frequency. Peak frequency is reached just before the occurrence of the motor response. It is suggested that rhythmical slow activity in the hippocampus and diencephalon are the electrical sign of activity in a forebrain mechanism which organizes or initiates higher (voluntary) motor acts. No support is found for previous suggestions that such waves are specifically related to generalized arousal, orienting responses, learning, attention or approach behavior.

Median raphe lesion, suppression of 5-HT neuronal activity by administration of GABAA receptor antagonist or by glutamate blockade or depletion produced long-lasting non-interrupted hippocampal theta in freely behaving rats independent of behavior and in rats anesthetized with urethane. Serotonergic neurons show a characteristic sleep\textendash wake pattern of activity and there is evidence that GABAergic mechanisms play an important role in their regulation. In this study we analyzed the distribution and subcellular localization of GABAB receptors in the midbrain raphe complex using combined 5-HT/GABAB receptor immunohistochemistry at the light and electron microscopic levels and studied the effects of their pharmacological manipulation on hippocampal electroencephalographic activity in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that sustained infusion of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen into the median raphe nucleus, using the microdialysis technique, elicited lasting theta activity in the hippocampus. The effect was antagonized by selective GABAB receptor antagonists. The predominant localization of GABAB receptors in the median, as well as in dorsal raphe was found on serotonergic neurons which strongly indicates that the increase in theta occurrence after baclofen injection resulted from suppression of the serotonergic output originating from the median raphe. On the electron microscopic level, we found GABAB receptors located extrasynaptically indicating that these receptors are preferentially activated by strong inputs, i.e. when GABA released from the synaptic terminals is sufficient to spill over from the synaptic cleft. Such conditions might be satisfied during rapid eye movement sleep when GABAergic neurons in the raphe are firing at their highest rate and in rhythmic synchronized bursts. Our data indicate that midbrain raphe GABAB mechanisms play an important role in behavioral state control and in hippocampal activity, in particular.},

GABAergic neurons exhibiting highly regular firing coupled to the hippocampal theta rhythm are thought to form the core of the MS rhythm-generating network. In recent studies the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated non-selective cation (HCN) channel was shown to participate in theta synchronization of the medial septum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HCN channel expression correlates with theta modulated firing behaviour of MS neurons by a combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach. HCN-expressing neurons represented a subpopulation of GABAergic cells in the MS partly overlapping with parvalbumin (PV)-containing neurons. Rhythmic firing in the theta frequency range was characteristic of all HCN-expressing neurons. In contrast, only a minority of HCN-negative cells displayed theta related activity. All HCN cells had tight phase coupling to hippocampal theta waves. As a group, PV-expressing HCN neurons had a marked bimodal phase distribution, whereas PV-immunonegative HCN neurons did not show group-level phase preference despite significant individual phase coupling. Microiontophoretic blockade of HCN channels resulted in the reduction of discharge frequency, but theta rhythmic firing was perturbed only in a few cases. Our data imply that HCN-expressing GABAergic neurons provide rhythmic drive in all phases of the hippocampal theta activity. In most MS theta cells rhythm genesis is apparently determined by interactions at the level of the network rather than by the pacemaking property of HCN channels alone.},

Recent research establishes the foundations for a broad range of creative neurotechnologies that enable unique modes of operation in this context. This review focuses on those systems with proven utility in animal model studies and with levels of technical maturity that suggest a potential for broad deployment to the neuroscience community in the relatively near future. We include a brief summary of existing and emerging neuroscience techniques, as background for a primary focus on device technologies that address associated opportunities in electrical, optical and microfluidic neural interfaces, some with multimodal capabilities. Examples of the use of these technologies in recent neuroscience studies illustrate their practical value.

We hypothesized that sustained activation of neuroendocrine stress systems (e.g., corticosteroid release via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) by alcohol intoxication and withdrawal and consequent alterations in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation drive compulsive alcohol drinking. Our results showed that rats exposed to alcohol vapor to the point of dependence displayed increased alcohol intake, compulsive drinking measured by progressive-ratio responding, and persistent alcohol consumption despite punishment, assessed by adding quinine to the alcohol solution, compared with control rats that were not exposed to alcohol vapor. No group differences were observed in the self-administration of saccharin-sweetened water. Acute alcohol withdrawal was accompanied by downregulated GR mRNA in various stress/reward-related brain regions [i.e., prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)], whereas protracted alcohol abstinence was accompanied by upregulated GR mRNA in the NAc core, ventral BNST, and central nucleus of the amygdala. No significant alterations in MR mRNA levels were found. Chronic GR antagonism with mifepristone (RU38486) prevented the escalation of alcohol intake and compulsive responding induced by chronic, intermittent alcohol vapor exposure. Chronic treatment with mifepristone also blocked escalated alcohol drinking and compulsive responding during protracted abstinence. Thus, the GR system appears to be involved in the development of alcohol dependence and may represent a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of alcoholism.},

  abstract = {Hyperdopaminergic states in mental disorders are associated with disruptive deficits in decision making. However, the precise contribution of topographically distinct mesencephalic dopamine pathways to decision-making processes remains elusive. Here we show, using a multidisciplinary approach, how hyperactivity of ascending projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to impaired flexible decision~making in rats. Activation of the VTA\textendash nucleus accumbens pathway leads to insensitivity to loss and punishment due to impaired processing of negative reward prediction errors. In contrast, activation of the VTA\textendash prefrontal cortex pathway promotes risky decision making without affecting the ability to choose the economically most beneficial option. Together, these findings show how malfunction of ascending VTA projections affects value-based decision making, suggesting a potential mechanism through which increased forebrain dopamine signaling leads to aberrant behavior, as is seen in substance abuse, mania, and after dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Advanced imaging methods now allow cell-type-specific recording of neural activity across the mammalian brain, potentially enabling the exploration of how brain-wide dynamical patterns give rise to complex behavioural states1\textendash 12. Dissociation is an altered behavioural state in which the integrity of experience is disrupted, resulting in reproducible cognitive phenomena including the dissociation of stimulus detection from stimulus-related affective responses. Dissociation can occur as a result of trauma, epilepsy or dissociative drug use13,14, but despite its substantial basic and clinical importance, the underlying neurophysiology of this state is unknown. Here we establish such a dissociation-like state in mice, induced by precisely-dosed administration of ketamine or phencyclidine. Large-scale imaging of neural activity revealed that these dissociative agents elicited a 1\textendash 3-Hz rhythm in layer~5 neurons of the retrosplenial cortex. Electrophysiological recording with four simultaneously deployed high-density probes revealed rhythmic coupling of the retrosplenial cortex with anatomically connected components of thalamus circuitry, but uncoupling from most other brain regions was observed\textemdash including a notable inverse correlation with frontally projecting thalamic nuclei. In testing for causal significance, we found that~rhythmic optogenetic activation of retrosplenial cortex layer~5 neurons recapitulated dissociation-like behavioural effects. Local retrosplenial hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) pacemakers were required for systemic ketamine to induce this rhythm and to elicit dissociation-like behavioural effects. In a patient with focal epilepsy, simultaneous intracranial stereoencephalography recordings from across the brain revealed a similarly localized rhythm in the homologous deep posteromedial cortex that was temporally correlated with pre-seizure self-reported dissociation, and local brief electrical stimulation of this region elicited dissociative experiences. These results identify the~molecular, cellular and physiological properties of a conserved deep posteromedial cortical rhythm that underlies states of dissociation.},

The medial habenula (MHb) is a phylogenetically-conserved epithalamic structure that is a powerful modulator of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Here, we show that a robust endocannabinoid signaling system modulates synaptic transmission between the MHb and its sole identified GABA input, the medial septum and nucleus of the diagonal band (MSDB). With RNAscope in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that key enzymes that synthesize or degrade the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide are expressed in the MHb and MSDB, and that cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is expressed in the MSDB. Electrophysiological recordings in MHb neurons revealed that endogenously-released 2-AG retrogradely depresses GABA input from the MSDB. This endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) was limited by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) but not by fatty acid amide hydrolase. Anatomic and optogenetic circuit mapping indicated that MSDB GABA neurons monosynaptically project to cholinergic neurons of the ventral MHb. To test the behavioral significance of this MSDB\textendash MHb endocannabinoid signaling, we induced MSDB-specific knockout of CB1 or MAGL via injection of virally-delivered Cre recombinase into the MSDB of Cnr1loxP/loxP or MgllloxP/loxP mice. Relative to control mice, MSDB-specific knockout of CB1 or MAGL bidirectionally modulated 2-AG signaling in the ventral MHb and led to opposing effects on anxiety- and depressive-like behavior. Thus, depression of synaptic GABA release in the MSDB-ventral MHb pathway may represent a potential mechanism whereby endocannabinoids exert anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects.},

These alterations were associated with a specific reduction in the firing of the identified rhythmic bursting GABAergic neurons responsible for the propagation of the theta rhythm to the hippocampus, but without loss of medial septal neurons. Such results indicate that hippocampal Abeta treatment leads to a specific functional depression of inhibitory projection neurons of the medial septum, resulting in the functional impairment of the temporal network.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper was to evaluate the cholinergic component of the septohippocampal input signals in neuronal activity of the hippocampal fields CA1 and CA3 recorded extracellularly in chronic alert rabbits. Effects of electrical stimulation of the medial septal area were analysed in the control state, on the background of an increased level of endogenous acetylcholine (by physostigmine injection) and during its blockade by antimuscarinic drugs (scopolamine, atropine). Two groups of animals were used in the experiments: intact rabbits and rabbits with complete chronic undercutting of the septum, depriving the septohippocampal system of ascending medial forebrain bundle afferents. Primary inhibitory effects of standard duration (40\textendash 140 ms) evoked by medial septal area stimulation dominated in the hippocampus of intact rabbits (54\%), though some neurons responded by initial diffuse excitation (37.5\%); responses by single-spike on-effects were observed in a minority of neurons (8.5\%). The primary suppression of activity prevailed (90\%) in animals with basal undercutting of the septum. In intact rabbits under physostigmine action, the effects of medial septal area stimulation were depressed or completely blocked in 78\% of hippocampal neurons on the background of increased theta modulation of activity. Neuronal responses to medial septal area stimulation recovered at the background of muscarinic antagonists. These effects of cholinergic drugs were reproduced in animals without medial forebrain bundle. It is concluded that the initial effect of the septal input upon the hippocampal neurons consists of a general suppression of their activity (reset), depending upon a non-cholinergic (presumably GABAergic) component of the septohippocampal connections. The efficacy of extraseptal (brainstem-diencephalic) and primary (inhibitory) septal influences upon hippocampal neurons is limited on the background of an increased level of endogenous acetylcholine.},

The use and implantation of high-channel-count silicon probes represent the largest cost and experimental complexity associated with such recordings making a recoverable and reusable system desirable. To address this, we have designed and tested a novel 3D printed head-gear system for freely moving mice and rats. The system consists of a recoverable microdrive printed in stainless steel and a plastic head cap system, allowing researchers to reuse the silicon probes with ease, decreasing the effective cost, and the experimental effort and complexity. The cap designs are modular and provide structural protection and electrical shielding to the implanted hardware and electronics.

Nevertheless, the network mechanism whereby the brain integrates this information to signal the anticipation of rewards remains relatively unexplored. Here we employ multi-circuit electrical recordings from six brain regions as mice perform a sample-to-match task in which reward anticipation is operationalized as their progress towards obtaining a potential reward. We then use machine learning to discover the naturally occurring network patterns that integrate this neural activity across timescales. Only one of the networks that we uncovered signals responses linked to reward anticipation, specifically relative proximity and reward magnitude. Activity in this \emph{Electome} (\emph{electrical functional connectivity}) network is dominated by theta oscillations leading from prelimbic cortex and striatum that converge on ventral tegmental area, and by beta oscillations leading from striatum that converge on prelimbic cortex. Network activity is also synchronized with brain-wide cellular firing. Critically, this network generalizes to new groups of healthy mice, as well as a mouse line that models aberrant neural circuitry observed in brain disorders that show altered reward anticipation. Thus, our findings reveal the network-level architecture whereby the brain integrates spatially distributed activity across timescales to signal reward anticipation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In general, fear is elicited when threat is proximal, while anxiety is a response to threat that is distal and uncertain.

We studied avoid-approach conflict in rats that were behaving in a predator-inhabited foraging arena task that involved tangible threat and reward incentives. In the task, rats exhibited a variety of both fearful and anxious behaviors corresponding to proximal and distal threat, respectively. We then administered ethanol or diazepam to the rats in order to study how anxiolytics affected these fear and anxiety behaviors. We discovered that both ethanol and diazepam attenuated proximal-threat fear-like behaviors. Furthermore, we found that diazepam, but not ethanol, increased distal-threat anxiety-like behavior but also made rats less risk-averse. Finally, we describe how decisional conflict can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process and characterize a potential relationship between anxious behavior, diazepam's ability to suppress hippocampal theta oscillations, and hippocampal representations of the future.},

  abstract = {Aims Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), often associated with cognitive impairment, is one of the most common types of medically refractory epilepsy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) shows considerable promise for the treatment of TLE. However, the optimal stimulation targets and parameters of DBS to control seizures and related cognitive impairment are still not fully illustrated. Methods In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of DBS in the medial septum (MS) on seizures and cognitive function in mouse acute and chronic epilepsy models. Results We found that DBS in the MS alleviated the severity of seizure activities in both kainic acid-induced acute seizure model and hippocampal-kindled epilepsy model. DBS showed antiseizure effects with a wide window of effective stimulation frequencies. The antiseizure effects of DBS were mediated by the hippocampal theta rhythm, as atropine, which reversed the DBS-induced augmentation of the hippocampal theta oscillation, abolished the antiseizure effects of DBS. Further, in the kainic acid-induced chronic TLE model, DBS in the MS not only reduced spontaneous seizures, but also improved behavioral performance in novel object recognition. Conclusion DBS in the MS is a promising approach to attenuate TLE probably through entrainment of the hippocampal theta rhythm, which may be therapeutically significant for refractory TLE treatment.},

  abstract = {Secondary generalized seizure (sGS) is a major source of disability in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with unclear cellular/circuit mechanisms. Here we found that clinical TLE patients with sGS showed reduced volume specifically in the subiculum compared with those without sGS. Further, using optogenetics and extracellular electrophysiological recording in mouse models, we found that photoactivation of subicular GABAergic neurons retarded sGS acquisition by inhibiting the firing of pyramidal neurons. Once sGS~had been stably acquired, photoactivation of GABAergic neurons aggravated sGS expression via depolarized GABAergic signaling. Subicular parvalbumin, but not somatostatin subtype GABAergic, neurons were easily depolarized in sGS expression. Finally, photostimulation of subicular pyramidal neurons genetically targeted with proton pump Arch, rather than chloride pump NpHR3.0, alleviated sGS expression. These results demonstrated that depolarized GABAergic signaling in subicular microcircuit mediates sGS in TLE. This may be of therapeutic interest in understanding the pathological neuronal circuitry underlying sGS. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies indicated the involvement of cholinergic neurons in seizure; however, the specific role of the medial septum (MS)-hippocampus cholinergic circuit in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has not yet been completely elucidated. Methods In the current study, we used magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to characterize the pathological change of the MS-hippocampus circuit in 42 patients with TLE compared with 22 healthy volunteers. Using optogenetics and chemogenetics, combined with in~vivo or in~vitro electrophysiology and retrograde rabies virus tracing, we revealed a direct MS-hippocampus cholinergic circuit that potently attenuates seizure through driving somatostatin inhibition in animal TLE models. Results We found that patients with TLE with hippocampal sclerosis showed a decrease of neuronal fiber connectivity of the MS-hippocampus compared with healthy people. In the mouse TLE model, MS cholinergic neurons ceased firing during hippocampal seizures. Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of MS cholinergic neurons (but not glutamatergic or GABAergic [gamma-aminobutyric acidergic] neurons) significantly attenuated hippocampal seizures, while specific inhibition promoted hippocampal seizures. Electrophysiology combined with modified rabies virus tracing studies showed that direct (but not indirect) MS-hippocampal cholinergic projections mediated the antiseizure effect by preferentially targeting hippocampal GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of hippocampal somatostatin-positive (rather than parvalbumin-positive) subtype of GABAergic neurons reversed the antiseizure effect of the MS-hippocampus cholinergic circuit, which was mimicked by activating somatostatin-positive neurons. Conclusions These findings underscore the notable antiseizure role of the direct cholinergic MS-hippocampus circuit in TLE through driving the downstream somatostatin effector. This may provide a better understanding of the changes of the seizure circuit and the precise spatiotemporal control of epilepsy.},

We focused on the early-stage disease progression and examined the neuronal network functioning in the 5xFAD mice. The simultaneous intracranial recordings were obtained from the hippocampal perforant path (PP) and the dentate gyrus (DG). Concomitant to A{$\beta$} accumulation, theta power was strongly attenuated in the PP and DG regions of 5xFAD mice compared to those in nontransgenic littermates. For either theta rhythm or gamma oscillation, the phase synchronization on the PP-DG pathway was impaired, evidenced by decreased phase locking value and diminished coherency index. To alleviate the neural oscillatory deficits in early-stage AD, a neural modulation approach (rTMS) was used to activate gamma oscillations and strengthen the synchronicity of neuronal activity on the PP-DG pathway. In brief, there was a significant neuronal network dysfunction at an early-stage AD-like pathology, which preceded the onset of cognitive deficits and was likely driven by A{$\beta$} accumulation, suggesting that the neural oscillation analysis played an important role in early AD diagnosis.},

Moreover, we see secondary effects in brain regions anatomically distinct from and functionally connected to the sonicated region, indicating that ultrasonic drug uncaging could noninvasively map the changes in functional network connectivity associated with pharmacologic action at a particular brain target.},

Its cellular mechanisms remain a matter of debate, and previous computational work has focused mostly on mechanisms intrinsic to the hippocampus. On the other hand, experimental data indicate that GABAergic cells in the medial septum play a pacemaker role for the theta rhythm. We have used biophysical modeling to address two major questions raised by the septal pacemaker hypothesis: what is the ion channel mechanism for the single-cell pacemaker behavior and how do these cells become synchronized? Our model predicts that theta oscillations of septal GABAergic cells depend critically on a low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current. Network simulations show that theta oscillations are not coherent in an isolated population of pacemaker cells. Robust synchronization emerges with the addition of a second GABAergic cell population. Such a reciprocally inhibitory circuit can be realized by the hippocampo-septal feedback loop.},

Previous studies suggest that selective pharmaco-genetic inhibition of pyramidal neurons has therapeutic value for the treatment of epilepsy, however there is a risk of disrupting normal physical functions. Here, we test whether pharmaco-genetic activation of parvalbumin neurons, which are transgenetically transduced with the modified muscarinic receptor hM3Dq can attenuate TLE. We found that pharmaco-genetic activation of hippocampal parvalbumin neurons in epileptogenic zone not only significantly extends the latency to different seizure stages and attenuates seizure activities in acute seizure model, but also greatly alleviates the severity of seizure onsets in two chronic epilepsy models. This manipulation did not affect the normal physical function evaluated in various cognitive tasks. Further, the activation of parvalbumin neurons produced an inhibition on parts of surrounding pyramidal neurons, and the direct inactivation of pyramidal neurons via the viral expression of a modified muscarinic receptor hM4Di produced a similar anti-ictogenic effect. Interestingly, pharmaco-genetic inactivation of pyramidal neurons was more sensitive to impair cognitive function. Those data demonstrated that pharmaco-genetic seizure attenuation through targeting parvalbumin neurons rather than pyramidal neurons may be a novel and relatively safe approach for treating refractory TLE.},

Because reward values often change over time, even on a subsecond-by-subsecond basis, appropriate behavioral regulation requires continuous value monitoring. However, the phasic dopamine activity, which is sporadic and has a short duration, likely fails continuous monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a tonic firing mode of dopamine neurons that effectively tracks changing reward values. We recorded dopamine neuron activity in monkeys during a Pavlovian procedure in which the value of a cued reward gradually increased or decreased. Dopamine neurons tonically increased and decreased their activity as the reward value changed. This tonic activity was evoked more strongly by non-burst spikes than burst spikes producing a conventional phasic activity. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons change their firing mode to effectively signal reward values in a given situation.},

However, as ultrasonic bioeffects and its adjustments are still unclear, it remains difficult to be extensively applied for therapeutic purpose, much less in the setting of human skull. Hence to comprehensively understand the way ultrasound exerts bioeffects, we explored UNM from a basic perspective by illustrating the parameter settings and the underlying mechanisms. In addition, although the spatial resolution and precision of UNM are considerable, UNM is relatively nonspecific to tissue or cell type and shows very low specificity at the molecular level. Surprisingly in 2015, Ibsen and his colleagues first proposed the concept of sonogenetics, which combined UNM and mechanosensitive (MS) channel protein. This emerging approach is a valuable improvement, as it may markedly increase the precision and spatial resolution of UNM. It seemed to be an inspiring tool with high accuracy and specificity, however, little information about sonogenetics is currently available. Thus, in order to provide an overview of sonogenetics and prompt the researches on UNM, we summarized the potential mechanisms from a molecular level.},

Moreover, neurons from different parts of that distribution were differentially modulated by sleep substates. Periods of nonREM sleep reduced the activity of high firing rate neurons and tended to upregulate firing of slow-firing neurons. By contrast, the effect of REM was to reduce firing rates across the entire rate spectrum. Microarousals, interspersed within nonREM epochs, increased firing rates of slow-firing neurons. The net result of sleep was to homogenize the firing rate distribution. These findings are at variance with current homeostatic models and provide a novel view of sleep in adjusting network excitability.},

Although US neuromodulation has appeared robust in rodent studies, the effects of US in large mammals and humans have been modest at best. In addition, there is a lack of direct recordings from the stimulated neurons in response to US. Our study investigates the magnitude of the US effects on neuronal discharge in awake behaving monkeys and thus fills the void on both fronts. Objective/Hypothesis In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of recording action potentials in the supplementary eye field (SEF) as TUS is applied simultaneously to the frontal eye field (FEF) in macaques performing an antisaccade task. Results We show that compared to a control stimulation in the visual cortex, SEF activity is significantly modulated shortly after TUS onset. Among all cell types 40\% of neurons significantly changed their activity after TUS. Half of the neurons showed a transient increase of activity induced by TUS. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that the neuromodulatory effects of non-invasive focused ultrasound can be assessed in real time in awake behaving monkeys by recording discharge activity from a brain region reciprocally connected with the stimulated region. The study opens the door for further parametric studies for fine-tuning the ultrasonic parameters. The ultrasonic effect could indeed be quantified based on the direct measurement of the intensity of the modulation induced on a single neuron in a freely performing animal. The technique should be readily reproducible in other primate laboratories studying brain function, both for exploratory and therapeutic purposes and to facilitate the development of future clinical TUS devices.},

A key, long-standing question in neuroscience is to understand the neural correlates of such behavioral variability. To reveal these correlates, behavior and neural population activity must be related to one another on single trials. Such analysis is challenging due to the dynamical nature of brain function (e.g., in decision making), heterogeneity across neurons and limited sampling of the relevant neural population. By analyzing population recordings from mouse frontal cortex in perceptual decision-making tasks, we show that an analysis approach tailored to the coarse grain features of the dynamics is able to reveal previously unrecognized structure in the organization of population activity. This structure is similar on error and correct trials, suggesting dynamics that may be constrained by the underlying circuitry, is able to predict multiple aspects of behavioral variability and reveals long time-scale modulation of population activity.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive description of the organization of projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, which together with projections to other subfields of the hippocampal formation form the so-called perforant pathway. To this end, data that are primarily from anatomical studies in the rat will be summarized, complimented with comparative data from other species. The analysis of the organization of any of the connections of the hippocampus, including that of the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, is severely hampered because of the complex three-dimensional shape of the hippocampus. In particular in rodents, but to a lesser extent also in primates, all traditional planes of sectioning will result in sections that at some point or another do not cut through the hippocampus at an angle that is perpendicular to its long axis. To amend this, we will describe own unpublished tracing data obtained in the rat with the use of the so-called extended preparation. A number of issues will be addressed. First, data will be summarized which will clarify the laminar origin of the perforant pathway within the entorhinal cortex. Second, we will discuss whether or not a radial organization, along the proximo-distal dendritic axis of granule cells, characterizes the entorhinal-dentate projection. Third, we will discuss whether this projection is governed by any transverse organization, and fourth, we will focus on the organization along the longitudinal axis. Finally, the synaptic organization and the contralateral entorhinal-dentate projection will be described briefly. Taken together, the available data suggest that the projection from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus is a fairly well conserved connection, present in all species studied, exhibiting a grossly similar organization.},

Propidium iodide or Evans Blue was infused into the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, dorsal retrohippocampal region, amygdala, and the entorhinal, perirhinal, pyriform, insular, and cingular cortices. Retrogradely transported fluorescent labels and ChAT and/or AChE were microscopically analyzed on the same brain section. Virtually all of the cholinergic projections to the limbic telencephalon derived from the basal forebrain cholinergic system composed of neurons associated with the medial septal nucleus, nuclei of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, the magnocellular preoptic area, the subpallidal substantia innominata and its rostral extension into the regions of the ventral pallidum laterally and the lateral preoptic area medially, and the nucleus basalis. The cingulate cortex received a small cholinergic projection from the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus in the brainstem. All of the presumed cholinergic innervation of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and dorsal retrohippocampal area and the majority of cholinergic afferents to posterior cingulate and entorhinal cortices derived from the medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic area, and rostral substantia innominata. Putative cholinergic afferents to the amygdala and to pyriform, insular, perirhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices originated from ChAT-positive cells concentrated more caudally in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Within the basal forebrain, no simple topographic pattern emerged to explain the cholinergic innervation of the limbic telencephalon, although an essentially reverse rostrocaudal organization was observed for afferents to the cingular region. It was noted, however, that most regions of the limbic telencephalon received cholinergic input from rostral portions of the basal forebrain cholinergic system, an observation inviting speculation that anterior aspects of the basal forebrain provide cholinergic afferents primarily to limbic structures in the telencephalon whereas more caudal portions are the source of cholinergic fibers preferentially innervating non-limbic regions. Of the total number of projection neurons innervating a given region of the limbic telencephalon, a greater proportion was ChAT-positive if phylogenetically newer target structures were innervated. A good correlation was observed between intensely staining AChE-containing and ChAT-positive neurons projecting to the limbic telencephalon.},

Links between D2R levels, cognitive performance, and suppression of the default mode network (DMN) during executive functioning have been observed in healthy and addicted populations; however, there is limited evidence regarding a potential role of elevated D3R in influencing cognitive control processes in groups with and without addictions. Sixteen individuals with cocaine-use disorder (CUD) and 16 healthy comparison (HC) participants completed [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET imaging of D2R and D3R availability and fMRI during a Stroop task of cognitive control. Independent component analysis was performed on fMRI data to assess DMN suppression during Stroop performance. In HC individuals, lower D2R-related binding in the dorsal putamen was associated with improved task performance and greater DMN suppression. By comparison, in individuals with CUD, greater D3R-related binding in the substantia nigra was associated with improved performance and greater DMN suppression. Exploratory moderated-mediation analyses indicated that DMN suppression was associated with Stroop performance indirectly through D2R in HC and D3R in CUD participants, and these indirect effects were different between groups. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a dissociative and potentially beneficial role of elevated D3R availability in executive functioning in cocaine-use disorder.},

Exciting work in this area is beginning to identify intersecting pathways that orchestrate the movement of these critical neuroendocrine cells into the central nervous system, both spatially and temporally, through a diverse and changing terrain. Once within the forebrain, little is known about how the axons target the median eminence and ultimately secrete GnRH-1 in a pulsatile fashion.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to identify the sites of origin of the noradrenergic fibers that project to areas containing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) perikarya since norepinephrine (NE) is known to influence the activity of GnRH neurons. Fluorescent retrograde tracers were used in combination with immunohistochemistry for dopamine-{$\beta$}-hydroxylase (DBH) and GnRH. Small volumes of either Fluoro-gold (FG) or Fluoro-Ruby (FR) were pressure injected into areas that contain the largest number of GnRH cell bodies, i.e., the medial septum-diagonal band complex or preoptic area. Retrogradely labeled neurons were observed ipsilaterally in the following noradrenergic cell groups: A2 (in the nucleus tractus solitarii), A1 (in the ventrolateral medulla) and locus coeruleus. Approximately 8\% of all DBH-positive neurons within the A2-cell group were retrogradely labeled, while 12\% of DBH-ir neurons in the A1-group were double-labeled. Only a few retrogradely labeled DBH-ir neurons were observed in the locus coeruleus ({$<$}1\%). Double-labeled neurons were not organized into discrete cell groups, but were dispersed among other NE-neurons within the A2- and A1-cell groups. The highest concentrations of double-labeled neurons were located in the central one-third of both the A2 and A1 cell groups. The results suggest that most noradrenergic terminals in the region of the GnRH perikarya in the medial septum-diagonal band/rostral preoptic area originate from ipsilateral neurons in areas A1 and A2. These data support the view that the medullary cell groups A1 and A2, and not the locus coeruleus, are the primary sites of origin of the noradrenergic component that is crucial for the direct regulation of GnRH perikarya.},

As EEMD is a time\textendash space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer.

  abstract = {The high comorbidity between obesity and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, often exacerbates metabolic and neurological symptoms significantly. However, neural mechanisms that underlie reciprocal control of feeding and mental states are largely elusive. Here we report that melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) neurons located in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminus (dBNST) engage in the regulation of mentally associated weight gain by receiving GABAergic projections from hypothalamic AgRP neurons onto {$\alpha$}5-containing GABAA receptors and serotonergic afferents onto 5-HT3 receptors. Chronic treatment with a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly blunts the hyperexcitability of AgRP neurons in response to not only hunger but also anxiety and depression-like stimuli. Such HFD-mediated desensitization reduces GABAergic outputs from AgRP neurons to downstream MC4RdBNST neurons, resulting in severe mental dysregulation. Genetic enhancement of the GABAAR-{$\alpha$}5 or suppression of the 5-HT3R within the MC4RdBNST neurons not only abolishes HFD-induced anxiety and depression but also robustly reduces body weight by suppression of food intake. To gain further translational insights, we revealed that combined treatment of zonisamide (enhancing the GABAAR-{$\alpha$}5 signaling) and granisetron (a selective 5-HT3R antagonist) alleviates mental dysfunction and yields a robust reversal of diet-induced obesity by reducing total calorie intake and altering food preference towards a healthy low-fat diet. Our results unveil a neural mechanism for reciprocal control of appetite and mental states, which culminates in a novel zonisamide-granisetron cocktail therapy for potential tackling the psychosis-obesity comorbidity.},

Histamine-containing neurones of the tuberomammillary nucleus densely innervate the cholinergic and GABAergic nucleus of the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) which projects to the hippocampus and sustains hippocampal theta rhythm and associated learning and memory functions. Here we demonstrate that histamine, acting via H1 and/or H2 receptor subtypes, utilizes direct and indirect mechanisms to excite septohippocampal GABA-type neurones in a reversible, reproducible and concentration-dependent manner. The indirect mechanism involves local ACh release, is potentiated by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and blocked by atropine methylbromide and 4-DAMP mustard, an M3 muscarinic receptor selective antagonist. This indirect effect, presumably, results from a direct histamine-induced activation of septohippocampal cholinergic neurones and a subsequent indirect activation of the septohippocampal GABAergic neurones. In double-immunolabelling studies, histamine fibres were found in the vicinity of both septohippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic cell types. These findings have significance for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders involving a loss of septohippocampal cholinergic neurones as such a loss would also obtund histamine effects on septohippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic functions and further compromise hippocampal arousal and associated cognitive functions.},

We previously reported that the cognitive enhancer ST101, which stimulates T-VGCCs in rat cortical slices, was a potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutic. Here, we introduce a more potent T-VGCC enhancer, SAK3 (ethyl 8{${'}$}-methyl-2{${'}$},4-dioxo-2-(piperidin-1-yl)-2{${'}$}H-spiro[cyclopentane-1,3{${'}$}-imidazo [1,2-a]pyridin]-2-ene-3-carboxylate), and characterize its pharmacological properties in brain. Based on whole cell patch-clamp analysis, SAK3 (0.01\textendash 10~nM) significantly enhanced Cav3.1 currents in neuro2A cells ectopically expressing Cav3.1. SAK3 (0.1\textendash 10~nM~nM) also enhanced Cav3.3 but not Cav3.2 currents in the transfected cells. Notably, Cav3.1 and Cav3.3~T-VGCCs were localized in cholinergic neurve systems in hippocampus and in the medial septum. Indeed, acute oral administration of SAK3 (0.5~mg/kg, p.o.), but not ST101 (0.5~mg/kg, p.o.) significantly enhanced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampal CA1 region of na\"ive mice. Moreover, acute SAK3 (0.5~mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly enhanced hippocampal ACh levels in olfactory-bulbectomized (OBX) mice, rescuing impaired memory-related behaviors. Treatment of OBX mice with the T-VGCC-specific blocker NNC 55-0396 (12.5~mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized both enhanced ACh release and memory improvements elicited by SAK3 administration. We also observed that SAK3-induced ACh releases were significantly blocked in the hippocampus from Cav3.1 knockout (KO) mice. These findings suggest overall that T-VGCCs play a key role in cognition by enhancing hippocampal ACh release and that the cognitive enhancer SAK3 could be a candidate therapeutic in Alzheimer's disease.},

In vivo microdialysis revealed a  24\% increase in the hippocampal interstitial fluid Ab42 levels immediately after acute light activation. Five months of chronic optogenetic stimulation increased Ab burden specifically in the projection area of the perforant pathway (i.e., outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) of the stimulated side by  2.5-fold compared with that in the contralateral side. Epileptic seizures were observed during the course of chronic stimulation, which might have partly contributed to the Ab pathology. These findings implicate functional abnormalities of specific neuronal circuitry in Ab pathology and Alzheimer disease.},

Depression has been suggested to be the result of maladaptive changes in specific brain circuits. Recently, the lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a key brain region in the pathophysiology of depression. Increasing evidence from rodent, non-human primate and human studies indicates that the aberrant activity of the LHb is associated with depressive symptoms such as helplessness, anhedonia, and excessive negative focus. Revealing the molecular, cellular and circuit properties of the LHb will help explain how abnormalities in LHb activity are linked to depressive disorders, and shed light on developing novel strategies for depression treatment.},

  abstract = {Behavioural experiences activate the FOS transcription factor in sparse populations of neurons that are critical for encoding and recalling specific events1\textendash 3. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which experience drives circuit reorganization to establish a network of Fos-activated cells. It is also not~known whether FOS is required in this process beyond serving as a marker of recent neural activity and, if so, which of its many gene targets underlie circuit reorganization. Here we demonstrate that when mice engage in spatial exploration of novel environments, perisomatic inhibition of Fos-activated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is enhanced, whereas perisomatic inhibition by cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons is weakened. This bidirectional modulation of inhibition is abolished when the function of the FOS transcription factor complex is disrupted. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, ribosome-associated mRNA profiling and chromatin analyses, combined with electrophysiology, reveal that FOS activates the transcription of Scg2, a gene that encodes multiple distinct neuropeptides, to coordinate these changes in inhibition. As parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons mediate distinct features of pyramidal cell activity4\textendash 6, the SCG2-dependent reorganization of inhibitory synaptic input might be predicted to affect network function in vivo. Consistent with this prediction, hippocampal gamma rhythms and pyramidal cell coupling to theta phase are significantly altered in the absence of Scg2. These findings reveal an instructive role for FOS and SCG2 in establishing a network of Fos-activated neurons via the rewiring of local inhibition to form a selectively modulated state. The opposing plasticity mechanisms acting on distinct inhibitory pathways may support the consolidation of memories over time.},

To investigate \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{PV\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{MS-DBB\}\}\$\$transmission, light pulses at 5\textendash 50~Hz frequencies generated trains of inhibitory~postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CA1 stratum oriens interneurons.

  abstract = {Hippocampal theta rhythm (HPC\texttheta ) may be important for various phenomena, including attention and acquisition of sensory information. Two types of HPC\texttheta{} (types I and II) exist based on pharmacological, behavioral, and electrophysiological characteristics. Both types occur during locomotion, whereas only type II (atropine-sensitive) is present under urethane anesthesia. The circuit of HPC\texttheta{} synchronization includes the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MSDB), with cholinergic and {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons comprising the two main projections from MSDB to HPC. The primary aim of the present study was to assess the effects of GABAergic MSDB lesions on urethane- and locomotion-related HPC\texttheta, and compare these effects to those of cholinergic MSDB lesions. Saline, kainic acid (KA), or 192 IgG-saporin (SAP) was injected into MSDB before recording. KA preferentially destroys GABAergic MSDB neurons, whereas SAP selectively eliminates cholinergic MSDB neurons. A fixed recording electrode was placed in the dentate mid-molecular layer, and stimulating electrodes were placed in the posterior hypothalamus (PH), and medial perforant path (PP). Under urethane anesthesia, HPC\texttheta{} was induced by tail pinch, PH stimulation, and systemic physostigmine; none of the rats with KA or SAP showed HPC\texttheta{} in any of these conditions. During locomotion, HPC\texttheta{} was attenuated, but not eliminated, in rats with KA or SAP lesions. Intraseptal KA in combination with either intraseptal SAP or PP lesions reduced locomotion-related HPC\texttheta{} beyond that observed with each lesion alone, virtually eliminating HPC\texttheta. In contrast, intraseptal SAP combined with PP lesions did not reduce HPC\texttheta{} beyond the effect of each lesion alone. We conclude that both GABAergic and cholinergic MSDB neurons are necessary for HPC\texttheta{} under urethane, and that each of these septohippocampal projections contributes to HPC\texttheta{} during locomotion. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In the present work, we find that the conditioned context activates projection neurons from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the PVT, and the inhibition of PrL-PVT projection neurons inhibits the conditioned context-induced retrieval of morphine withdrawal memory; the conditioned context induces an increase in Arc expression, intrinsic excitability, and glutamate output in PrL-PVT projection neurons in morphine-withdrawn mice.

The classical feedback-inhibitory HIPPs distribute axon fibers in the molecular layer. They are engaged by converging GC-inputs and provide dendritic inhibition to the DG circuitry. In contrast, SOMIs with axon in the hilus, termed hilar interneurons (HILs), provide perisomatic inhibition onto GABAergic cells in the DG and project to the medial septum. Repetitive activation of glutamatergic inputs onto HIPP cells induces long-lasting-depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission but long-term-potentiation (LTP) of synaptic signals in HIL cells. Thus, LTD in HIPPs may assist flow of spatial information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG, whereas LTP in HILs may facilitate the temporal coordination of GCs with activity patterns governed by the medial septum.},

Since many of the projection neurons are located in subcortical basal forebrain structures, where the delineation of individual regions is difficult, particular care was taken to localize projection neurons with respect to such landmarks as the ventral pallidum (identified on the basis of GAD immunoreactivity), the diagonal band, and medial forebrain bundle. In addition, sections with fluorescent tracers or immunofluorescence were counterstained for Nissl substance in order to correlate tracer or immunopositive neurons with the cytoarchitecture of the basal forebrain. The majority of the cholinergic bulbopetal neurons are located in the medial half of the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB), whereas only a few are located in its lateral half. A substantial number of cholinergic bulbopetal cells are also found in the sublenticular substantia innominata. A small number of cholinergic bulbopetal neurons, finally, are located in the ventrolateral portion of the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band. At the level of the crossing of the anterior commissure, approximately 17\% of the bulbopetal neurons in the HDB are ChAT-positive. The noncholinergic bulbopetal cells are located mainly in the lateral half of the HDB. GAD-containing bulbopetal neurons are primarily located in the caudal part of the HDB, especially in its lateral part. About 30\% of the bulbopetal projection neurons in the HDB are GAD-positive. A few GAD-positive bulbopetal cells, furthermore, are located in the ventral pallidum, anterior amygdaloid area, deep olfactory cortex, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, lateral hypothalamic area, and tuberomamillary nucleus. The topography of bulbopetal neurons was compared to other projection neurons in the HDB. After multiple injections of fluorescent tracer in the neocortex, retrogradely labeled neurons were concentrated in the most medial part of the HDB, while neurons projecting to the olfactory and entorhinal cortices were located in the ventral part of the HDB. These results show that the cells of the HDB can be divided into subpopulations based upon projection target as well as transmitter content. Furthermore, these subpopulations correspond, at least to a considerable extent, to areas that can be defined on cyto- and fibroarchitectural grounds.},

Moreover, co-administration of the subthreshold dose of mecamylamine (2{$\mu$}g/rat) plus nicotine at the dose of 0.5 or 0.6mg/kg, increased or decreased the anxiolytic-like behaviors, respectively. On the other hand, sole intra-medial septum infusion of atropine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist, induced an anxiolytic (0.05{$\mu$}g/rat) and anxiogenic (0.25{$\mu$}g/rat)-like effects, respectively. The dose of 0.05{$\mu$}g/rat however, blocked the nicotine response. Furthermore, intra-medial septum microinjection of the highest dose of mecamylamine (4{$\mu$}g/rat) plus nicotine (0.6mg/kg) decreased the locomotor activity, while other treatments had no effect on this parameter.

Spectral analyses showed that network oscillations within the theta- and gamma-frequency bands were not different between APP-KO and wild-type mice. Surprisingly, however, while gamma amplitude coupled to theta phase in all recorded regions of wild-type animals, in APP-KO mice theta-gamma coupling was strongly diminished in recordings from the parietal cortex and hippocampus, but not in LFPs recorded from the prefrontal cortex. Thus, lack of APP reduces oscillatory coupling in LFP recordings from specific brain regions, despite not affecting the amplitude of the oscillations. Together, our findings reveal reduced cross-frequency coupling as a functional marker of APP deficiency at the network level.},

Some studies but not others show that lesions or inhibition of the MS reduce anxiety-like behaviors and locomotive exploration in rats. However, these conclusions come from manipulations that are either irreversible or non-specific to cholinergic neurons, casting doubt on their validity. With DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), we temporarily and reversibly inhibited cholinergic neurons in the MS. We observed consistent anxiolytic effects of MS cholinergic inhibition in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, the marble burying test and the elevated plus-maze test, as well as increased exploratory activities in the open field test. These findings confirm an excitatory role of the MS cholinergic neurons in the control of innate anxiety, and reconcile conflicting findings from previous studies using irreversible lesions or non-specific inhibition.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Anxiety commonly co-occurs with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Both of them are closely related to stress. However, the shared neurobiological substrates and therapeutic targets remain unclear. Here we report an amelioration of both anxiety and OCD via the histamine presynaptic H3 heteroreceptor on glutamatergic afferent terminals from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, a vital node in the limbic loop. The NAc core receives direct hypothalamic histaminergic projections, and optogenetic activation of hypothalamic NAc core histaminergic afferents selectively suppresses glutamatergic rather than GABAergic synaptic transmission in the NAc core via the H3 receptor and thus produces an anxiolytic effect and improves anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors induced by restraint stress. Although the H3 receptor is expressed in glutamatergic afferent terminals from the PrL, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (vHipp), rather than the thalamus, only the PrL\textendash{} and not BLA\textendash{} and vHipp\textendash NAc core glutamatergic pathways among the glutamatergic afferent inputs to the NAc core is responsible for co-occurrence of anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors. Furthermore, activation of the H3 receptor ameliorates anxiety and obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors induced by optogenetic excitation of the PrL\textendash NAc glutamatergic afferents. These results demonstrate a common mechanism regulating anxiety- and obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors and provide insight into the clinical treatment strategy for OCD with comorbid anxiety by targeting the histamine H3 receptor in the NAc core.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Emotions evoked by environmental cues are important for animal survival and life quality. However, neural circuits responsible for transforming sensory signals to aversive emotion and behavioral avoidance remain unclear. Here, we found that medial septum (MS) mediates aversion induced by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Ablation of glutamatergic or GABAergic MS neurons results in impaired or strengthened aversion, respectively. Optogenetic activation of the two cell types results in place avoidance and preference, respectively. Cell-type-specific screening reveals that glutamatergic MS projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) are responsible for the induction of aversion, which can be antagonized by GABAergic MS projections to LHb. Additionally, the sensory-induced place avoidance is facilitated by enhanced locomotion mediated by glutamatergic MS projections to the preoptic area. Thus, MS can transmit innately aversive signals via a bottom-up multimodal sensory pathway and produce concurrent emotional and motional effects, allowing animals to efficiently avoid unfavorable environments.},

  abstract = {In hippocampal area CA1 of rats, the frequency of gamma activity has been shown to increase with running speed (Ahmed and Mehta, 2012). This finding suggests that different gamma frequencies simply allow for different timings of transitions across cell assemblies at varying running speeds, rather than serving unique functions. However, accumulating evidence supports the conclusion that slow ({$\sim$}25\textendash 55 Hz) and fast ({$\sim$}60\textendash 100 Hz) gamma are distinct network states with different functions. If slow and fast gamma constitute distinct network states, then it is possible that slow and fast gamma frequencies are differentially affected by running speed. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that slow and fast gamma frequencies change differently as a function of running speed in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Fast gamma frequencies increased with increasing running speed in all three areas. Slow gamma frequencies changed significantly less across different speeds. Furthermore, at high running speeds, CA3 firing rates were low, and MEC firing rates were high, suggesting that CA1 transitions from CA3 inputs to MEC inputs as running speed increases. These results support the hypothesis that slow and fast gamma reflect functionally distinct states in the hippocampal network, with fast gamma driven by MEC at high running speeds and slow gamma driven by CA3 at low running speeds. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Using extracellular recording techniques in urethane- (1g/kg, i.p.) anaesthetized rats, we investigated the influence exercised by medial septal cholinergic neurons on dorsal hippocampus field CA1 neural responses to a hind paw injection of formalin (5\%, 0.05ml, s.c.). Cholinergic neurons of the medial septal region were destroyed by local microinjection of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin. Compared to control vehicle microinjected animals, immunotoxin-treatment attenuated the amplitude, but not frequency, of CA1 theta induced by intraseptal injection of carbachol. This suggested a selective destruction of medial septal cholinergic neurons by the immunotoxin. Such destruction also abolished; (i) intraseptal carbachol-induced suppression of CA1 population spike, and (ii) stimulation-intensity dependent increase in amplitude, but not frequency, of theta evoked on electrical stimulation in the region of oral part of pontine reticular nucleus. Further, in comparison to vehicle-treated animals, selective cholinergic destruction attenuated formalin-induced; (i) theta activation, (ii) suppression of CA1 pyramidal cell population spike and dendritic field excitatory post-synaptic potential, (iii) inhibition of complex spike cell extracellular activity, and (iv) excitation and theta-rhythmicity of local putative GABAergic interneurons. However, pretreatment with the immunotoxin did not alter the strength and proportion of complex spike cells excited following injection of formalin From these findings we suggest that medial septal cholinergic neurons mediate, at least partly, the amplitude of theta and pyramidal cell suppression via an inhibitory network involving CA1 interneurons. The data also indicates that during formalin theta, the cholinergic-mediated inhibitory processing does not modulate the strength and selectivity of complex spike cell excitation. This points to formalin-induced, non-overlapping inhibitory and excitatory processes that might have different functional relevance.},

We report here several novel purification strategies that involve the use of non-ionic iodixanol gradients followed by ion exchange or heparin affinity chromatography by either conventional or HPLC columns. These methods result in more than 50\% recovery of rAAV from a crude lysate and routinely produce vector that is more than 99\% pure. More importantly, the new purification procedures consistently produce rAAV stocks with particle-to-infectivity ratios of less than 100, which is significantly better than conventional methods. The new protocol increases the overall yield of infectious rAAV by at least 10-fold and allows for the complete purification of rAAV in 1 working day. Several of these methods should also be useful for large-scale production.},

  abstract = {Biological oscillations can be controlled by a small population of rhythmic pacemaker cells, or in the brain, they also can emerge from complex cellular and circuit-level interactions. Whether and how these mechanisms are combined to give rise to oscillatory patterns that govern cognitive function are not~well understood. For example, the activity of hippocampal networks is temporally coordinated by a 7-~to 9-Hz local field potential (LFP) theta rhythm, yet many individual cells decouple from the LFP frequency to oscillate at frequencies {$\sim$}1~Hz higher. To better understand the network interactions that produce these complex oscillatory patterns, we asked whether the relative frequency difference between LFP and individual cells is retained when the LFP frequency is perturbed experimentally. We found that rhythmic optogenetic stimulation of medial septal GABAergic neurons controlled the hippocampal LFP frequency outside of the endogenous theta range, even during behavioral states when endogenous mechanisms would otherwise have generated 7- to 9-Hz theta oscillations. While the LFP frequency matched the optogenetically induced stimulation frequency, the oscillation frequency of individual hippocampal cells remained broadly distributed, and in a subset of cells including interneurons, it was accelerated beyond the new base LFP frequency. The inputs from septal GABAergic neurons to the hippocampus, therefore, do not appear to directly control the cellular oscillation frequency but rather engage cellular and circuit mechanisms that accelerate the rhythmicity of individual cells. Thus, theta oscillations are an example of cortical oscillations that combine inputs from a subcortical pacemaker with local computations to generate complex oscillatory patterns that support cognitive functions.},
